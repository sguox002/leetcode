### Problem summary
. matches any single char
* matches 0 or more of preceding char

### idea
1. two string direct dp problem, dp[i, j] represents if s[0...i-1] matches p[0...j-1]
2. p[j-1] is letter or ., dp[i, j]=dp[i-1, j-1]&&(s[i-1]==p[j-1]||p[j-1]=='.')
3. p[j-1]=='*', assuming previous char is a, then a*
  - matches 0 char, previous char is skipped, a* matches empty, dp[i,j]=dp[i,j-2] (s(0...i-1) matches p(0...j-3). Note: we are using previous solution for current solution!)
  - matches 1 char, then dp[i,j]=(s[i-1]==p[j-2] || p[j-2]=='.') && dp[i,j-1] (a* counts as one a, s(0..i-1) matches p[0..j-2])
  - matches more than 1 char, a* represents multiple a, dp[i,j]=(s[i-1]==p[j-2] || p[j-2]=='.') && dp[i-1,j] (depends s(0...i-2) matches p(0...j-1)). Actually this case is included in match 1 char.
4. boundary condition
  - dp[0,0]=1, empty vs empty
  - p empty, s non-empty, all false
  - s empty, p non-empty, must have .* letter* to match 0 char dp[0,i]=dp[0, i-2] && p[j-1]=='*'
5. extra complexity: it involves p[j-2] and dp[j-2], which indicates that row 1 needs to be included in boundary. A common approach is: we do not involve the boundary except dp[0,0], but using the recurrence relation to process the boundary. This is much simpler in some cases when the boundary is not so straightforward.

### code
```cpp
    bool isMatch(string s, string p) {
        int m=s.size(),n=p.size();
        vector<vector<bool>> dp(m+1,vector<bool>(n+1));
        dp[0][0]=1;
        //p is empty, s non-empty all false is straightforward dp[i][0]=0
        //put other boundary in loops
        for(int i=0;i<=m;i++)
        {
            for(int j=1;j<=n;j++)
            {
                if(p[j-1]!='*') dp[i][j]=i && dp[i-1][j-1] && (s[i-1]==p[j-1] || p[j-1]=='.');
                else dp[i][j]=(j>1 &&dp[i][j-2]) 
                    || (i && j>1 && dp[i][j-1] && (s[i-1]==p[j-2] || p[j-2]=='.'))
                    || (i && j>1 && dp[i-1][j] && (s[i-1]==p[j-2] || p[j-2]=='.'));
            }
        }
        return dp[m][n];
    }
    ```
  
  ### comments
  1. when boundary is hard to write, include it in the loop
  2. a* matches empty, then it means previous solution shall be s(0..i-1) matches p(0..j-3), which is dp[i, j-2]
  3. a* matches 1, then it means previous solution is s(0..i-2) matches p(0..j-1) which is dp[i-1,j]
  4. the last condition can be skipped.
