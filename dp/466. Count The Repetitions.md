### problem summary
define S=[s,n] repeat s n times and get S
given s1 and s2, S1=[s1,n1], S2=[s2,n2]
find the max M so that [S2,M] is a subsequence of S1
n1 is [0 1e6] and n2 is [1 1e6]
s1 and s2 max length is 100

### analysis
the repeated string is up to 10^8. Even O(N) algorithm may get TLE.
if character in s2 is not in s1, then answer is 0

Not a typical dp problem but more likely a greedy problem.

Brutal force: two pointers 
find the repeating pattern of s2 in S1.
What is a repeating cycle? 
The first or last character position of s2 matching position in S1 (repeating segment and its inside index)
When an identical inside index is found, we know the cycle length is the segment!

When we reach the ending char of s2, we reached one segment, record the position in S1 and number of segment of s2 in a hashmap with the key i%s1.length().
When a repeat pattern is found, i%s1.length appeared in the hashmap, then we can safely skip all the repeating pattern until to the remaining part.

```cpp
    int getMaxRepetitions(string s1, int n1, string s2, int n2) {
        //greedy choice to find the repeat pattern
        int i=0,j=0; //i is for s1 and j is for s2
        int nseg2=0,nseg1=0;
        int m=s1.size(),n=s2.size();
        if(m*n1<n*n2) return 0;
        if(!contains(s1,s2)) return 0;
        unordered_map<int,vector<int>> start_indx; //key is starting inside a seg
        //value0: the repeat number of s2, value 1: the index in S1
        while(i<n1*m)
        {
            while(s1[i%m]!=s2[j%n]) i++;
            if(j%n==n-1) //first char
            {
                nseg2++;
                if(start_indx.count(i%m)) //have found repeat pattern
                {
                    int T=i-start_indx[i%m][0];//the repeat period
                    int R=nseg2-start_indx[i%m][1]; //the repeat s2 segment
                    int nremain=(n1*m-i-1)/T;
                    
                    i+=nremain*T;
                    j+=nremain*R*n;
                    //cout<<T<<" "<<R<<" "<<nremain<<": "<<i<<" "<<j;
                    nseg2+=nremain*R;                    
                }
                else start_indx[i%m]=vector<int>({i,nseg2});
            }
            i++,j++;
        }
        return nseg2/n2;
    }
    bool contains(string s1,string s2)
    {
        unordered_set<char> cs1(s1.begin(),s1.end());
        unordered_set<char> cs2(s2.begin(),s2.end());
        for(auto it=cs2.begin();it!=cs2.end();it++)
            if(cs1.count(*it)==0) return 0;
        return 1;
    }
```

### comments
- the beginning and ending part shall be treated iteratively
- the mid part is the repeating part and can be skipped
- some apparent non-match shall be pruned first, including length problem and s2 is not a subset of s1.
- I tried to find an equation but failed many times, and has to switch to above solution
