### Problem Summary
Given a list of balloons with number on it. If a balloon is burst, point num[l]*num*num[r] will be added. (l,r is the adjacent left and right balloon)
Ask: to return max point we can get

### idea
1. add a guardian to avoid boundary. add 1 to left and 1 to right
2. every time we burst a balloon, it depends on the left and right index (we do not want to alter the array and it will be a big mess). It is naturally to use left and right in the dp solutions
3. Once we want to burst balloon i, its points will be nums[i]*nums[l]*nums[r]. And it leaves two parts l to i-1 and i+1 to r. (Between l and r there are multiple elements, we are just assuming after some bursting, l and r becomes adjacent). This is similar to a reverse process. When we solve l, i, r, the previous problem (l, i-1) and (i+1, r) have all be solved. In another word, those balloons are all bursted already.
4. so the recurrence dp[l, r]=max(num[i]*num[l]*num[r]+dp[l,i-1]+dp[i+1,l]), i from l to r

### code
```cpp
    int maxCoins(vector<int>& nums) {
        nums.insert(nums.begin(),1);
        nums.push_back(1);
        int n=nums.size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n,vector<int>(n));
        return helper(nums,1,n-2,dp);
    }
    int helper(vector<int>& nums,int s,int e,vector<vector<int>>& dp)
    {
        if(s>e) return 0;
        if(dp[s][e]>0) return dp[s][e];
        for(int i=s;i<=e;i++)
        {
            dp[s][e]=max(dp[s][e],nums[i]*nums[s-1]*nums[e+1]+helper(nums,s,i-1,dp)+helper(nums,i+1,e,dp));
        }
        return dp[s][e];
    }
```

### comments
1. start,end are all possible balloon to burst, its left and right are its adjacent. So it is num[i]*num[s-1]*num[e+1]
2. terminate condition then is s>e (s==e is allowed for a single element left)
3. dp[s,e] is exactly a subproblem from start to end (a continuous partial array)
4. These details reflect the correct understanding of the method and shall pay special attention.
