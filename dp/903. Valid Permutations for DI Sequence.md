### Problem Summary
D: decrease A[i]>A[i+1], I: increase, A[i]<A[i+1]
Given numbers from 0 to n and DI string of length=n
Ask: number of valid permutations

### idea
let dp[i,j] represents number of valid permutation with string length i (given number 0 to i) and ending number j
when D: previous number shall be bigger, i.e, j+1 to n, then dp[i,j]=sum(dp[i-1,k]) k=j..i-1 
when I: previous number shall be smaller, i.e from 0 to j-1 then dp[i,j]=sum(dp[i-1,k]) k=0...j-1

final answer: i=n, ending with 0 to n

boundary condition: It only needs previous row values, so the 0th row shall be provided.
i=0, dp[0,0]=1
Actually this is a lower triangle, we do not need to calculate the whole row, they are not used.

### code
```cpp
    int numPermsDISequence(string S) {
        int n=S.length();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n+1,vector<int>(n+1));
        //dp[i,j] represents len=i, ending with j (j=0 to i)
        dp[0][0]=1;
        //for(int i=0;i<=n;i++) dp[0][i]=1;
        int mod=1e9+7;
        for(int i=1;i<=n;i++)
        {
            for(int j=0;j<=i;j++)
            {
                if(S[i-1]=='D') //previous is larger
                {
                    for(int k=j;k<i;k++) {dp[i][j]+=dp[i-1][k];dp[i][j]%=mod;}
                }
                else for(int k=0;k<j;k++) {dp[i][j]+=dp[i-1][k];dp[i][j]%=mod;}
            }
        }
        //print(dp);
        return accumulate(dp[n].begin(),dp[n].end(),0LL)%mod;
    }
```

### comment
1. when D, **why sum from j to i-1 instead from j+1 to i**? Because for (0...i-1) cases, k can only change from 0 to i-1. for (0..i) case, j can from 0 to i. The j is used already in the previous solution.

So, why start with j, not j + 1, since the sequence is decreasing to j?
Thought Experiment: 
In the sequence with length of i-1, the largest number in this sequence should be i-1. 
However, when we are dealing with length i and end with j, the previous sequence has already another j and we should also add i to the sequence. What we can do is, add one to all those numbers greater than or equal to j. This operation will make the largest number to be i without breaking the sequence property, also, it will free the j so that we can use it at the end of the sequence.
