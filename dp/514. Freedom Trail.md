### Problem Summary
On a ring, there is a string. Initially the 0th character is on 12:00 direction. Given a keyword, we need in turn to rotate the letter to 12:00 direction and select it.
Ask: the minimum steps (rotation + selection)

### idea
1. selection can be ignored since each letter requires exactly one selection.
2. support clockwise and anti-clockwise rotation. Greedy choice will not work to choose the min distance of clockwise and counter-clockwise since it may affect the following rotations
3. correct way is to choose all possible positions and solving the remaining subproblem using its position as the reference point. This is a dfs approach.
4. For convenience we maintain a hashmap with the key as the char and list of positions as its value.

### code
```cpp
    int findRotateSteps(string ring, string key) {
        //dfs
        int n=ring.size(),m=key.size();
        vector<vector<int>> mp(26);
        for(int i=0;i<ring.size();i++) mp[ring[i]-'a'].push_back(i);
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n,vector<int>(m));
        int minSteps=minsteps(mp,key,0,vector<int>(1,0),n,dp);
        return minSteps+key.length();
    }
    
    int minsteps(vector<vector<int>>& mp,string& key,int start,vector<int> prev,int n,vector<vector<int>>& dp)
    {
        if(start==key.length()) {return 0;}
        if(dp[prev.back()][start]) return dp[prev.back()][start];
        vector<int>& v=mp[key[start]-'a'];
        int sum=INT_MAX;
        for(int i=0;i<v.size();i++)
        {
            int d=abs(v[i]-prev.back());
            d=min(d,n-d);
            prev.push_back(v[i]);
            sum=min(sum,d+minsteps(mp,key,start+1,prev,n,dp));
            prev.pop_back();
        }
        dp[prev.back()][start]=sum;
        return sum;
    }
```

### DP approach:
  dp approach shall use reverse thinking, using the key from right to left since the first status (0th char at 0th position) is known.
  dp[i, j]: represents the min number of moves for subproblem: ring position at i and spell the key 0...j-1. The final answer is dp[0,0].
  When we solved the subproblem i to n-1, and leaving the ring position at i.
  dp[i, j]=min(dp[v[k]][j+1]+d) d is the distance from v[k] to i, and v[k] is the position for key[j].
  
  
### comments
- previous position is the list of previous position, initialized as 0, since 0th char is at 0 move position
- start is the key position
