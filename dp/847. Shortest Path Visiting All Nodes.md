### problem summary
Given a graph with n nodes, the array gives the connected nodes to ith node. Graph is undirected. number of nodes <=12
Ask: get the min length to visit all nodes

### analysis
1. We shall try all nodes as the starting node.
2. using bitset as the visited for a limited number of nodes
3. shortest path problem generally uses bfs. Here we shall solve n node bfs
4. The key idea: when we add a node's children through some paths (indicated by the status) makes the length shorter. Then we need relax the length to the child

BFS procedure for one starting node:
-. push the node in the queue, set the bit
-. iterate on its children, relax the distance (initialize to max)
-. push the children node into queue
-. until queue is empty

for n nodes the bfs is similar. Just push all starting nodes in the queue. The later starting nodes keeps on relaxing the distances.
May worth a try to test if run n separate bfs the same.

The final answer is starting nodes is min for all i and status is 0b1111111..1.

dp[i,status] represents starting node i, status: all nodes visited.

### code
```cpp
    struct State{
        int mask,source;
        State(int m,int s):mask(m),source(s){}
    };
    int shortestPathLength(vector<vector<int>>& graph) {
        int m=graph.size();
        int len=1<<m;
        vector<vector<int>> dp(m,vector<int>(len,m*m));
        queue<State> qs;
        for(int i=0;i<m;i++) 
        {
            dp[i][1<<i]=0; //self to self distance is 0
            qs.push(State(1<<i,i)); //try all nodes as starting
        }
        while(!qs.empty()) //until no node is in the queue, which means no node can make it closer
        {
            State state=qs.front();qs.pop();
            for(int next:graph[state.source]) //connected nodes
            {
                int nextmask=state.mask|(1<<next);
                if(dp[next][nextmask]>dp[state.source][state.mask]+1) //if passing its parent node can be closer
                {
                    dp[next][nextmask]=dp[state.source][state.mask]+1;
                    qs.push(State(nextmask,next));//bfs next layer
                }
            }
        }
        //shortest path 
        int ans=INT_MAX;
        for(int i=0;i<m;i++) ans=min(ans,dp[i][(1<<m)-1]);
        return ans;
    }
