### Problem summary
Given a string, count all distinct subsequence

### idea
for example aba
a: ending with a
ab,b: ending with b
ba,aba: ending with a (a is duplicate and shall be removed)

Since the number of subsequence ending with same char could be very large, it is not suitable to store them in a data structure, hence we need find a way to get rid of those duplicates.

When we add a char to the end, we append a char to all previous string ending with from a to z. This is the key observation.
we can use an array of 26 to record the number.

adding all numbers together and the letter itself dp[c]=sum(dp(a to z))+1

### code
```cpp
    int distinctSubseqII(string S) {
        vector<int> dp(26); //store the number of strings ending with a char a to z
        int mod=1e9+7;
        for(int i=0;i<S.size();i++)
        {
            int ind=S[i]-'a';
            long long t=0;
            for(int j=0;j<26;j++) {t+=dp[j];t%=mod;}
            dp[ind]=t+1; //the letter itself
        }
        return accumulate(dp.begin(),dp.end(),0LL)%mod;
    }
```

### comments
- be sure to use long long to avoid overflow.
- use 26 char array and update the table is a common practice for string dp problem
