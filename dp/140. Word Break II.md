### Problem Summary
Given a string, and a list of words in dictionary, return all possible combinations using words in dictionary

### Idea
since we need combine words by words, using recursive + memoization is simpler. 
We use the front as the sub problem and the ending as the solved, which makes combination easier.
It uses the last word (may have different) recursively added.
for example "catsanddog" dict=["cat","cats","and","sand","dog"]
dog + sub problem catsand
and + sub problem cats -> cats and dog
sand + sub problem cat -> cat sand dog


```cpp
    unordered_map<string, vector<string>> m;

    vector<string> combine(string word, vector<string> prev)
    {
        for(int i=0;i<prev.size();++i)
            prev[i]+=" "+word;
        return prev;
    }

    vector<string> wordBreak(string s, vector<string>& wordDict) 
    {
        unordered_set<string> dict(wordDict.begin(),wordDict.end());
        return wordBreak(s,dict);
    }    

    vector<string> wordBreak(string s, unordered_set<string>& dict) 
    {
        if(m.count(s)) return m[s]; //take from memory
        vector<string> result;
        if(dict.count(s)){result.push_back(s);} //a whole string is a word
        for(int i=s.size()-1;i>=0;i--)
        {
            string word=s.substr(i);
            if(dict.count(word))
            {
                string rem=s.substr(0,i);
                vector<string> prev=combine(word,wordBreak(rem,dict));
                result.insert(result.end(),prev.begin(), prev.end());
            }
        }
        m[s]=result; //memorize
        return result;
    }
```    

### comments
1. the code is hard to understand. The prev is the solution for the front subproblem which returns a list of words (already combined), so we just append the later word into each of it. It uses the sub-problem: the string return a list of combined words (doing the cut and combination the same time)
2. for the above example:
dog + subproblem(catsand)
subproblem catsand returns a list:
"cats and"
"cat sand"
and then we append the dog which get the final answer.
3. when the subproblem cannot produce a combination, the result is empty and combine will also produce empty (which is a trick here)
