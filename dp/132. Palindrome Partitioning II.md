### Problem summary
find the min number of cut to make s a list of palindrome strings

### idea
assuming dp[i] is the number of min cut at position i, previous cut position is at j
s[i..j] has to be a palindrome string then
dp[i]=min(dp[i],dp[j]+1) for all dp[j]>0 && s[i..j] is palindrome

fixing the end is kind of clumsy for palindrome problem, if we consider i as the center and grows both end:
1. odd length with center at i and with radius j, s[i-j, i+j]
2. even length with center at i+0.5 and with radius j, s[i-j+1,i+j]

dp[i+j+1]=min(dp[i+j+1],dp[i-j]+1) odd
dp[i+j+1]=min(dp[i+j+1],dp[i-j+1]+1) even

Boundary condition:
max number of cuts for s with i length s[i]=i-1 (by cutting into a single characters)

### code
```cpp
    int minCut(string s) {
        int n=s.size();
        vector<int> dp(n+1);
        for(int i=0;i<=n;i++) dp[i]=i-1;
        int j=0;
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
        {
            //odd expanding
            j=0;while(i-j>=0 && i+j<n && s[i+j]==s[i-j]) dp[i+j+1]=min(dp[i+j+1],dp[i-j]+1),j++;
            //even expanding
            j=0;while(i-j+1>=0 && i+j<n  && s[i+j]==s[i-j+1]) dp[i+j+1]=min(dp[i+j+1],dp[i-j+1]+1),j++;
        }
        return dp[n];
    }
```

### comments
- dp[0]=-1 is necessary since dp[1] has to be 0 for one char.
