### Problem summary
given initial milage, a list of station at different position with adding milage. Find the min number of refueling station to reach target.

### idea
This is similar to the super egg drop problem.

By solving an equivalent dp problem: what is the max distance using a number of refuelings

assuming dp[i] is the max distance using i refueling stations

dp[i]=max(dp[i], dp[i-1]+gas[j]) with constrains dp[i-1]>=pos[j] (You have to be able to reach pos[j] to add the gas[j])

### code
```cpp
    int minRefuelStops(int target, int startFuel, vector<vector<int>>& stations) {
        int n=stations.size();
        vector<int> dp(n+1); //the largest miles at each station
        dp[0]=startFuel;
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++) //iterate on all stations
        {
            int pos=stations[i][0],gas=stations[i][1];
            for(int j=i;j>=0;j--)
            {
                if(dp[j]>=pos) dp[j+1]=max(dp[j+1],dp[j]+gas);  //previous station needs update
            }
        }
        for(int i=0;i<=n;i++) if(dp[i]>=target) return i;
        return -1;
    }
 ```
 
 ### comments
 - need iterate all stations and cannot early exit since each station may contribute to the max distance
