### problem summary
Given G people, a list of profit with person required, and a target profit P. If person is used for one project, then it cannot be used for another one.

Ask: the number of profitable scheme

### idea
First impression: this is a knapsack problem without repetition. All profitable scheme with total profit>=P. Or all profit >=P can be counted as P.

knapsack dp[i,p]: with number of items and weight p. Since each item can be chosen or not chosen, we iterate the item for all w.
There is another factor: the number of people, making it a 3D dp problem: 
dp[i, p, g]: i: number of items, p: target profit, g: number of people 

Assuming dp[i,p,g] is the number of combinations for using i projects, target profit p, and number of people g.
when we add ith element into it: dp[i,p+pi,g+gi]+=dp[i-1,p,g] (there is no min/max compare since it asks for the number of combinations)

i only involves with i-1, we can safely remove the first dimension but need to use reverse iteration to avoid using updated values

The final answer:
sum of all dp[P,g] 

### code
```cpp
    int profitableSchemes(int G, int P, vector<int>& group, vector<int>& profit) {
        int n=group.size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(P+1,vector<int>(G+1)); //dp is the number of combinations with p, g
        //reduced 3d to 2D
        int mod=1e9+7;
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
        {
            int p=profit[i],g=group[i];
            for(int pp=P;pp>=0;pp--)
            {
                for(int gg=G-g;gg>=0;gg--)
                {
                    int p1=pp+p;
                    if(p1>P) p1=P;
                    dp[p1][g+gg]=(dp[p1][g+gg]+dp[p][g])%mod;
                }
            }
        }
        return accumulate(dp[P].begin(),dp[P].end(),0LL)%mod;
    }
```
