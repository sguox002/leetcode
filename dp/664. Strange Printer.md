### Problem summary
Printer each move prints a list of same characters. Next print will be on the previous print, covering those under.
Given a string, get the min number of moves

### idea
1. the number of same char does not matter (different from previous problem on remove boxes which is depending on k)
2. when same char is separated, either we connect them or print differently. That is why it is the same as removing boxes.

We don't need the k dimension in this case, since number of char does not matter.
3. this is similar to a series of overlapped segments, greedy choice will not work.

### code
```cpp
    int strangePrinter(string s) {
        if(s.length()<1) return 0;
        string ss;
        //reduce the string first to avoid time or space TLE
        char c=s[0];
        ss+=s[0];
        for(int i=1;i<s.length();i++) if(s[i]!=c) {c=s[i];ss+=s[i];}
        s=ss;
        int n=s.length();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n,vector<int>(n));
        return helper(s,dp,0,n-1);
    }
    int helper(string& s,vector<vector<int>>& dp,int i,int j)
    {
        if(i>j) return 0;
        if(i==j) return 1;
        if(dp[i][j]) return dp[i][j];
        //k is the number of same char
        int res=1+helper(s,dp,i+1,j);//no char attached
        for(int m=i+1;m<=j;m++)
        {
            if(s[m]==s[i])
                res=min(res,helper(s,dp,i+1,m-1)+helper(s,dp,m,j));
        }
        dp[i][j]=res;
        return res;
    }
```

### comments
- please refer to remove boxes, which is almost the same.
