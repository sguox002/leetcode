### Problem Summary
a list of washing machine with some clothes inside, each move choose any number of machine and passing one clothes to machines on its left or right side.

Ask: the min number of move to make each machine the same load

### idea
target is the average load. We can elmininate those illegal cases. and then subtract the average. The new target will be 0.
A machine with positive value can only pass out clothes.
1. from left to right, we shall give all its load to right to make it 0 (does not matter it is negative or positive). number of move is abs(value). That is like accumulate.

2. the least steps we need to eventually finish this process is determined by the peak of abs(cnt) and the max of "gain/lose" array

### code
```cpp
    int findMinMoves(vector<int>& machines) {
        int n=machines.size();
        int avg=accumulate(machines.begin(),machines.end(),0);
        if(avg%n) return -1;
        avg/=n;
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++) machines[i]-=avg;
        int max0=0,cnt=0;
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
        {
            cnt+=machines[i];
            max0=max(max0,max(abs(cnt),machines[i]));
        }
        return max0;
    }
```

### comments
1. the machine with largest load shall give away all of it. That is one bound
2. at ith position, the prefix sum is another bound: which shall pass out or pass in to it. That is another bound.
3. be sure to include max0 self in the max function, otherwise it will only use current (local) max.
