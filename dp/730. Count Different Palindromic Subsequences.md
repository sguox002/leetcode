### Problem Summary
Given a string of length n, find the number of different Palindrome subsequences, string has only a,b,c,d
Attention: it asks for **subsequences**, not substring

### ideas
1. it is easy to extend to 26 chars

2. a palindrome string can be from i to j. It is naturally use a start, end pair, or a start, length pair to indicate a palindrome string.

3. dp natural thinking: we start from the (i,len) subproblem and extend to see if we can solve bigger problem
assuming we add a char to s[i, i+len-1] (we use xxxx to indicat the string which is palindrome):

4. if we define dp[i,len,x] as the number of different pal-subsequence starting at i, with length=len, with start/end char =x

if s[i]!='x', we can ignore (remove) first char, dp[i,len,x]=dp[i+1,len-1,x]
else if s[j]!='x', we can ignore (remove) last char, dp[i,len,x]=dp[i,len-1,x] (the head is x but tail is not)

if both are x: 
dp[i,len,x]=dp[i+1,len-2,'a']+dp[i+1,len-2,'b']+dp[i+1,len-2,'c']+dp[i+1,len-2,'d']+2

why?
  - we are adding one x to the head and one x to the tail, which makes xa..ax, xb..bx, xc..cx, xd..dx all different pal-subsequence. Since we are making the length increased by 2, and they are all different.
  
  - +2: we can add x and xx into it since we add two x into previous solution, and we at least have length>=3
  
for example: we have aabaa, the subsequence start and end with a:

a,aa,aaa,aaaa,aba,aabaa

when add a to head and tail, they become:

aaa,aaaa,aaaaaa,aabaa,aaabaaa

and we add a and aa into it.

5. since it only involves len-2, len-1 and len, we only need 3 matrices.

6. The final answer is the sum of start=0, len=n, and char=a, b, c, d

# Implementation
```cpp
    int countPalindromicSubsequences(string S) {
       int n=S.length();
        int mod=1e9+7;
        //dp[i][len][c]: represents starting at i, with length=len start and ending with c
        vector<vector<int>> dp0(n,vector<int>(4)),dp1(n,vector<int>(4)),dp2(n,vector<int>(4));
        //dp0:len, dp1: len-1, dp2: len-2
        for(int len=1;len<=n;len++)
        {
            for(int i=0;i+len<=n;i++)
            {
                for(int j=0;j<4;j++)
                {
                    dp0[i][j]=0;
                    if(len==1) {dp0[i][j]=(S[i]=='a'+j);continue;}
                    if(S[i]!='a'+j) dp0[i][j]=dp1[i+1][j];//dp[i][len][c]=dp[i+1][len-1][c]
                    else if(S[i+len-1]!='a'+j) dp0[i][j]=dp1[i][j];//dp[i,len,c]=dp[i,len-1,c]
                    else //both ==x
                    {
                        dp0[i][j]=2;
                        if(len>2) for(int k=0;k<4;k++) {dp0[i][j]+=dp2[i+1][k];dp0[i][j]%=mod;} //dp[i+1,len-2,k]
                    }
                    dp0[i][j]%=mod;
                }
            }
            //len increase
            dp2=dp1;
            dp1=dp0;
        }
        //final answer is sum(dp[0,n,c])
        return accumulate(dp0[0].begin(),dp0[0].end(),0LL)%mod;
    }
```

### comments
- it needs subsequence, not substring, this is very important to the understanding of the algorithm
- need special treat len=1 case
- need special treat len==2 case when add two char (empty)
- when an iteration on len is done, we need update len-1->len-2, len->len-1
- every time len shall be initialized since we reuse the matrix. that is why dp2[i][x]=0 is needed. Attention shall be paid to this.
