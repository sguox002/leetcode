### Problem summary
arithmetic subsequence: len>=3 and differene is the same
ask: number of arithmetic subsequence

### Idea
Suppose we are adding A[i] to A[0]...A[i-1]. It could form arithmetic subsequence ending with A[i]
1,3,5: 1 sub
1,3,5,7: 2 subs
1,3,5,7,9:
1,3,5: ending with 5, difference is 2
3,5,7
1,3,5,7: ending with 7, difference is 2
5,7,9
3,5,7,9
1,3,5,7,9: ending with 9, difference is 2
1,5,9: ending with 9, difference is 4

so adding A[i]:
1. it form a new arithmetic subsequence with difference d, dp[i][d]=1, 
2. it extends an existent array with difference d, dp[i][d]=sum(dp[j][d]+1), for all j<i when j has d
  - Why? since we may have duplicate numbers and they count.
  - what about starting from two elements? 
  for example 1,2,3, for 2, d=1. dp[2][1]=1, 
  for 3, we get dp[3][1]=1+1, dp[3][2]=1+0. But we only have 1 subsequence. (so when adding to results, we can just add the dp[j][d].
3. the final answer is the sum of all endings
4. since d can be negative range from INT_MIN to INT_MAX, using a hashmap is more suitable

boundary condition
all zero

### code
```cpp
    int numberOfArithmeticSlices(vector<int>& A) {
        if(A.empty()) return 0;
        vector<unordered_map<int,int>> dp(A.size());
        int res=0;
        for(int i=1;i<A.size();i++)
        {
            for(int j=i-1;j>=0;j--)
            {
                long long d=(long long)A[i]-A[j];
                if(d<=INT_MIN || d>=INT_MAX) continue;
                dp[i][d]++;
                if(dp[j].count(d)) 
                {
                    dp[i][d]+=dp[j][d];
                    res+=dp[j][d];//reason we add dp[j][d]: we need to get rid of those two-element slices
                }
            }
            
        }
        return res;
    }
```

### comment
1. using long long for difference is necessary to avoid overflow
2. we add dp[j][d] to make sure we are only counting len>=3 subsequences. (1 element dp is 0, 2 element dp is 1, 3 element dp is 2)
