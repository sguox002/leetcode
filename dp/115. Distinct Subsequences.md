### Problem Summary
return the number of distinct subsequence of S which is equal to t.

### idea
this is two string compare with only deletion in S is allowed,
The number of distinct subsequence is similar to climbing stairs.

if s[i-1]!=t[j-1], dp[i,j]=d[i-1,j] where we need skip this char
else we have two choices use this char or not: if we use dp[i,j]=dp[i-1,j-1]
if we do not use dp[i,j]=dp[i-1,j]

This is also similar to walking in a 2d matrix.

### code
```cpp
    int numDistinct(string s, string t) {
        //dp edit distance
        int m=s.size(),n=t.size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(m+1,vector<int>(n+1));
        //dp[i,j] represent number of subsequence for s(0...i) vs t[0..j]
        //allowing only deletion from s
        //boundary: dp[0,0]=1
        for(int i=0;i<=m;i++) dp[i][0]=1; //when t is empty, need delete all s
        for(int i=1;i<=m;i++)
        {
            for(int j=1;j<=n;j++)
            {
                if(s[i-1]!=t[j-1]) dp[i][j]=dp[i-1][j]; //need delete this char, i proceed one
                else dp[i][j]=dp[i-1][j-1]+dp[i-1][j]; //delete: i proceed one, keep: dp[i-1][j-1]
            }
        }
        return dp[m][n];
    }
```

### comments
- the key is when we delete char i-1, why it is dp[i-1,j] instead of dp[i-1,j-1]?
