### Problem Summary
Given n, from 0 to n, return the number of integers whose binary contains no consecuative 1s

### idea
1. convert n to binary, it will have m bits
2. can we solve problem when n=11111..1 with m bits case? 
Assuming dp[i] is the number of valid string with length i.
  - if previous bit is 1, then we can only add 0 dp[i][0]=dp[i-1][1]
  - if previous bit is 0, then we can add 1 or 0 dp[i][0]=dp[i-1][0], dp[i][1]=dp[i-1][1]
  - above is awkward, if we think in another way, 
  if we define a[i] as the number of valid strings ending with 0, b[i] is the string ending with 1
  we can add 0 no matter previous: 
  a[i]=a[i-1]+b[i-1], 
  we can add 1 only when previous is 0:
  b[i]=a[i-1]
3. subtract all over counted integers when number>n
-. when binary of N appears 11, we just break, since all next smaller
-. when binary of N appears 00, over count those ending with 1

### code
```cpp
    int findIntegers(int num) {
        string s;
        while(num) {s+=num%2+'0';num/=2;}
        reverse(s.begin(),s.end());//MSB is at 0
        int m=s.length();
        vector<int> dp0(m),dp1(m);
        dp0[0]=1,dp1[0]=1;
        for(int i=1;i<m;i++)
        {
            dp0[i]=dp0[i-1]+dp1[i-1];
            dp1[i]=dp0[i-1];
        }
        int result=dp0[m-1]+dp1[m-1];
        for(int i=1;i<m;i++)
        {
            if(s[i]=='1' && s[i-1]=='1') break;
            if(s[i]=='0' && s[i-1]=='0') result-=dp1[m-i-1];
        }
        return result;
    }
```

### comments
1. the string of n is in human preference with MSB at the first element in string
2. when previous of n is 00, we need minus dp1[m-i-1] (those > this number is ith bit is 1)
3. if we use LSB at 0, it is easier to understand
