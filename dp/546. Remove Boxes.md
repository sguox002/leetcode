### Problem Summary
Given a list of numbers (different colors), every time you can choose to remove continuous same number (box with same color). If you remove k boxes, you get point k^2.
Return the max point you can get.

### idea
for example [1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 3, 1]
You can remove 2 first, and let the 3 connected together, 9 points
1,3,3,4,3,1, remove the 4, get 1
1,3,3,3,1 remove the 3, get 9
1,1 remove 1, get 4 total: 23

assuming dp[i,j] is the max points you can get from i to j (inclusive). And the final answer would be dp[0, n-1].

we get the group a[i] to a[i+k], assuming the k+1 elements are the same color, then we have two choices:

    group them and get the score and delete them
    leave them for a while and process other first and hope to have a longer sequence and higher scores.

For the first case, the score is (k+1)^2+subproblem(i+k+1,j)
for the second case, assuming we find mth element==nums[i] and want to combine with a[i, i+k], then we need solve two subproblem first [i+k, m-1] with no previous same char and [m, j] with previous k+1 same char.

Thus the dp needs to add another dimension k, dp[i][j][k] defines the max score we get from the sequence i to j (inclusive) with number of same color box ahead.

dp[i][j][k]=max((k+1)^2+sub(i+k+1,j,0), sub(i+k+1,m-1,0), sub(m, j, k+1))

### code
```cpp
    int removeBoxes(vector<int> boxes) {
        int n = boxes.size();
        vector<vector<vector<int>>> dp(n,vector<vector<int>>(n,vector<int>(n)));
        return removeBoxesSub(boxes, 0, n - 1, 0, dp);
    }

    int removeBoxesSub(vector<int>& boxes, int i, int j, int k, vector<vector<vector<int>>>& dp) 
    {
        if (i > j) return 0;
        if (dp[i][j][k] > 0) return dp[i][j][k];
        for (; i + 1 <= j && boxes[i + 1] == boxes[i]; i++, k++); 
        // optimization: all boxes of the same color counted continuously from the first box should be grouped together
        int res = (k + 1) * (k + 1) + removeBoxesSub(boxes, i + 1, j, 0, dp);
        for (int m = i + 1; m <= j; m++) {
            if (boxes[i] == boxes[m]) {
                res = max(res, removeBoxesSub(boxes, i + 1, m - 1, 0, dp) + removeBoxesSub(boxes, m, j, k + 1, dp));
            }
        }
        dp[i][j][k] = res;
        return res;
    }
```

### comment
- recursive + memoization is more straightforward.
