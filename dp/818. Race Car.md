### Problem summary
Initial position 0 and speed +1, and given a target>0
Instruction A: position+=speed, speed*=2;
Instruction R: position no change, speed=+1 if negative, -1 if positive
Ask: minimum length of instructios

### idea
Greedy choice 1: accelerate until passing target 1+2+4+8+...+2^n>=target and then reverse back. Remaining is a subproblem with reduced target distance.
Greedy choice 2: acceleate and stop before the target, 1+2+4+...+2^n<=target, and then reverse back. Remaining is a subproblem with reduced target distance

choose the min of the two

1+2+4+..+2^n=2^(n+1)-1, total n+1 instructions
n+1+dp(2^(n+1)-target)+1 +1: represent the R

n+dp(target-2^n)+1, +1 represent the R
stop when it is 0
