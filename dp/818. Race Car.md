### Problem summary
Initial position 0 and speed +1, and given a target>0
Instruction A: position+=speed, speed*=2;
Instruction R: position no change, speed=+1 if negative, -1 if positive
Ask: minimum length of instructios

### idea
Greedy choice 1: accelerate until passing target 1+2+4+8+...+2^n>=target and then reverse back. Remaining is a subproblem with reduced target distance.
Greedy choice 2: acceleate and stop before the target, 1+2+4+...+2^n<=target, and then reverse back and go for some steps and reverse back again. Remaining is a subproblem with reduced target distance

choose the min of the two

1+2+4+..+2^n=2^(n+1)-1, total n instructions
n+dp(2^(n+1)-target)+1 +1: represent the R

Reverse before target is more complicated. We need get away from the target for some steps and then reverse back.
n+dp(target-2^n+2^m)+1, +2 represent two time of reverse. The number of m shall <n (we shall make the distance smaller)
stop when it is 0

### code
```cpp
    int dp[10001];
    int racecar(int t) {
        if (dp[t] > 0) return dp[t];
        int n = floor(log2(t)) + 1, res;
        if (1 << n == t + 1) dp[t] = n;
        else {
            dp[t] = racecar((1 << n) - 1 - t) + n + 1;
            for (int m = 0; m < n - 1; ++m)
                dp[t] = min(dp[t], racecar(t - (1 << (n - 1)) + (1 << m)) + n + m + 1);
        }
        return dp[t];
    }
```

### comments
- 1 to 2^n only n accelerations
- recursive with memoization is needed to avoid repeative solving same problems.
