### Problem Summary

from src to dst, find the cheapest cost using at most k stops

### idea

- since src is fixed, we only need calculate src to all other airport min cost and the answer is src to dst. Why we care about other dest, that is the nature of dp. We solve our problem from other solved problems.

- No need 3D space. Assuming dp[j, k] is the min cost from src to j using at most k stops.

- The key idea using dp approach is:

when we have k-1 stops, we add one more stop to check if the cost will be relaxed.

assuming the added airport is m, then dp[j, k]=min(dp[j, k], dp[m, k-1]+prices[m, j])

Boundary condition:

    1. src to src is 0
    2. src to other station directly is given in flights
    
### code
```cpp
    int findCheapestPrice(int n, vector<vector<int>>& flights, int src, int dst, int K) {
        vector<vector<int>> prices(n,vector<int>(n,INT_MAX)),dp(n,vector<int>(K+1,INT_MAX));
       
        for(int i=0;i<flights.size();i++) 
        {
            if(flights[i][0]==src) dp[flights[i][1]][0]=flights[i][2];
            prices[flights[i][0]][flights[i][1]]=flights[i][2];
        }
              
        for(int k=0;k<=K;k++) dp[src][k]=0;
        
        for(int k=1;k<=K;k++)
        {
            //add one stop based on previous k-1 stop
            for(int j=0;j<n;j++)
            {
                if(src==j) continue;
                for(int m=0;m<n;m++)
                {
                    if(dp[m][k-1]!=INT_MAX && prices[m][j]!=INT_MAX)
                    dp[j][k]=min(dp[j][k],dp[m][k-1]+prices[m][j]);
                }
            }

        }
        return dp[dst][K]==INT_MAX?-1:dp[dst][K];
    }
 ```
 ### comments on the code
 - we build a matrix on the prices, which may have other way to just use the flights, but it is not important
 - boundary: src to src is 0, src to other is given
 - there are quite a few similar problems with at most k times, they are all approached with similar idea: compare add one time on previous k-1 or not add. dp[k-1], dp[k-1]+one transaction.
 - based on above conclusion, there is another equivalent coding:
 ```cpp
         for(int k=1;k<=K;k++)
        {
            //add one stop based on previous k-1 stop
            for(int j=0;j<n;j++)
            {
                if(src==j) continue;
                dp[j][k]=dp[j][k-1]; //not add one stop
                for(int m=0;m<n;m++)
                {
                    if(dp[m][k-1]!=INT_MAX && prices[m][j]!=INT_MAX)
                    dp[j][k]=min(dp[j][k-1],dp[m][k-1]+prices[m][j]);
                }
            }
        }
```
