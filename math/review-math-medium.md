535. Encode and Decode TinyURL
using 0-9 a-z A-Z to form a tinyURL
tinyURL includes 6 chars from above

using hashmap: 
tiny url vs real url
id vs tinyURL
everytime we increase the id when a new url comes

        for (int n = 0; res.size() < R * C; n++) {
            for (int i = 0; i < n / 2 + 1; i++) {
                r += x, c += y;
                if (0 <= r && r < R && 0 <= c && c < C)
                    res.push_back({r, c});
            }
            tmp = x, x = y, y = -tmp;

877. Stone Game
even number of piles, total sum is odd. taking from either end.
who will win
can use dp
sum(piles(even)) < sum(piles[odd]), pick all odd
sum(piles(even)) > sum(piles[odd]), pick all even
always win

553. Optimal Division
perform float division. by adding parenthesis to reach max result
X1/X2/X3/../Xn will always be equal to (X1/X2) * Y, no matter how you place parentheses. i.e no matter how you place parentheses, X1 always goes to the numerator and X2 always goes to the denominator. Hence you just need to maximize Y. And Y is maximized when it is equal to X3 *..*Xn. So the answer is always X1/(X2/X3/../Xn) = (X1 *X3 *..*Xn)/X2

789. Escape The Ghosts
you and ghost can move 4 directions and move simultaneously. see if you can escape and reach the target position
Let's say you always take the shortest route to reach the target because if you go a longer or a more tortuous route, I believe the ghost has a better chance of getting you.
Denote your starting point A, ghost's starting point B, the target point C.
For a ghost to intercept you, there has to be some point D on AC such that AD = DB. Fix D. By triangle inequality, AC = AD + DC = DB + DC >= BC. What that means is if the ghost can intercept you in the middle, it can actually reach the target at least as early as you do. So wherever the ghost starts at (and wherever the interception point is), its best chance of getting you is going directly to the target and waiting there rather than intercepting you in the middle.

462. Minimum Moves to Equal Array Elements II
a move is to add +/-1 to an element
min moves to make the elements equal.
choose the median and make every number equal to median
Suppose you have two endpoints A and B, when you want to find a point C that has minimum sum of distance between AC and BC, the point C will always between A and B. Draw a graph and you will understand it. Lets keep moving forward. After we locating the point C between A and B, we can define that
dis(AC) = c - a; dis(CB) = b - c;
sum = dis(AC) + dis(CB) = b - a.
b - a will be a constant value, given specific b and a. Thus there will be no difference between points among A and B.

In this problem, we set two boundaries, saying i and j, and we move the i and j to do the computation.

```java
    public int minMoves2(int[] nums) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int i = 0, j = nums.length-1;
        int count = 0;
        while(i < j){
            count += nums[j]-nums[i];
            i++;
            j--;
        }
        return count;
    }
```

858. Mirror Reflection
reflection by expanding the rect in 2 directions and problem becomes a simple gcd problem

781. Rabbits in Forest
In a forest, each rabbit has some color. Some subset of rabbits (possibly all of them) tell you how many other rabbits have the same color as them. Those answers are placed in an array.

Return the minimum number of rabbits that could be in the forest.
For rabits with same colors, the answers must be the same. However, when the total amount of that same answer exceeds  'that answer + 1', there must be a new color. (say [3,3,3,3,3], the first four 3s indicates 4 rabits with the same color. The 5th 3 must represent a new color that contains 4 other rabits). We only calculate the amount of rabits with the same color once. Hashmap is used to record the frequency of the same answers. Once it exceeds the range, we clear the frequency and calculate again.

If x+1 rabbits have same color, then we get x+1 rabbits who all answer x.
now n rabbits answer x.
If n % (x + 1) == 0, we need n / (x + 1) groups of x + 1 rabbits.
If n % (x + 1) != 0, we need n / (x + 1) + 1 groups of x + 1 rabbits.

the number of groups is math.ceil(n / (x + 1)) and it equals to (n + x) / (x + 1) , which is more elegant.

672. Bulb Switcher II
flips all lights
flips all odd lights
flip all even lights
flip all 3k+1 lights
here are three important observations:

For any operation, only odd or even matters, i.e. 0 or 1. Two same operations equal no operation.
The first 3 operations can be reduced to 1 or 0 operation. For example, flip all + flip even = flip odd. So the result of the first 3 operations is the same as either 1 operation or original.
The solution for n > 3 is the same as n = 3.
For example, 1 0 0 ....., I use 0 and 1 to represent off and on.
The state of 2nd digit indicates even flip; The state of 3rd digit indicates odd flip; And the state difference of 1st and 3rd digits indicates 3k+1 flip.
In summary, the question can be simplified as m <= 3, n <= 3. I am sure you can figure out the rest easily.

12. Integer to Roman
```cpp
    string intToRoman(int num) {
        string s;
        char digit[4]={0}; //store the digits in decimal
        char roman[]={'I','V','X','L','C','D','M'};
        int val[]={1,5,10,50,100,500,1000};

        //start from the msb digit
        int start_indx=6; //1000
        for(int i=1000;i>=1;i/=10,start_indx-=2)
        {
            int digit=num/i;
            if(!digit) continue;
            if(digit<4) s.append(digit,roman[start_indx]);
            else if(digit<5) s=s+roman[start_indx]+roman[start_indx+1];
            else if(digit<9) {s+=roman[start_indx+1];s.append(digit-5,roman[start_indx]);}
            else s=s+roman[start_indx]+roman[start_indx+2];
            num-=digit*i;
        }
        return s;
    }
```
