### problem summary
by adding min number of chars in the front to make the string palindrome

### approach
The problem is to find the longest palindrome string starting with 0.
However brutal force TLE for all aaaaa since we have to repeat each char until the longest

The smartest approach using recursive
we use two pointers i and j from both end. if j goes to end, the whole string is a palindrome string.
that is a reverse compare. Otherwise, we divide the String by j, and get mid = s.substring(0, j) and suffix.

```cpp
    string shortestPalindrome(string s) {
        //find the longest palindrome in s and then use it as the base to add
        //the longest must start with the first char
        int n=s.size();
        int j = 0;
        for (int i = s.length() - 1; i >= 0; i--) 
        {
            if (s[i] == s[j]) { j += 1; }
        }
        if (j == s.length()) { return s; }
        string suffix=s.substr(j);
        string rss=suffix;
        reverse(rss.begin(),rss.end());
        return rss+shortestPalindrome(s.substr(0,j))+suffix;
    }
```
