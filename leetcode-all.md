### Introduction
This document is used for grep
each problem is tagged by <<-problem->> and each problem contains:
problem description
subject or approach
hard level

tag <<- and ->>. tags shall be different so that regex can get the start and end.

whole question: using <<-(.|[\r\n])*?->> to search problems.
add some more restrictives in the search, for example must contain greedy (ignoring case)

multiple subjects search: (?.*key1)(?.*key2) using looking-ahead

single keyword:
(?<=<<-)((?!->>).|[\r\n])?(keyw1)(.|[\r\n])?(?=->>)
<<-((?!->>).|[\r\n])?(keyw1)(.|[\r\n])?->>
two keywords:
<<-((?!->>).|[\r\n])?(keyw1|keyw2)((?!->>).|[\r\n])?(keyw1|keyw2)(.|[\r\n])?->>
demo using the search pattern:
<<-((?!->>).|[\r\n])*?(dp|greedy)((?!->>).|[\r\n])*?(dp|greedy)(.|[\r\n])*?->>

## algorithm focused Problems

### dp: edit distance, longest common subsequence et al.

<<-1682. Longest palindromic subsequence II
problem: palindromic subsequence needs to be even length, neighboring chars cannot be the same (except the mid pair).
dp[i,j,k] using 26 chars.
->>

<<-516	Longest Palindromic Subsequence    		54.4%	Medium	
equivalent to:
- longest common subsequence (LCS) (s and reversed s).
- min deletion edit distance (s and reversed s).
- dp[i,j] represent to max length for substr(i...j). 
s[i]==s[j] dp[i,j]=dp[i+1,j-1]+2
else dp[i,j]=max(dp[i+1,j],dp[i,j-1])
->>

<<-5. Longest Palindromic Substring
for substring, 
- dp: dp[i,j] s[i]==s[j] and inner side s[i+1..j-1] must also be a pal-string.
- non-dp: for all possible position, expand and update max size.
->>

<<-647. Palindromic Substrings
problem: count number of palindromic substring.
- non-dp: for all possible position, expand and get the count
- dp: dp[i,j] number of pal-string inside. then dp[i,j]=self+dp[i,j-1]+dp[i+1,j]-dp[i+1,j-1]
->>

<<-730. Count Different Palindromic Subsequences
number of unique palindromic subsequence.
needs unique, add one dimension, ending with char x. (only a,b,c,d are in the string).
dp[i,j,c] represent the number of unique pal-subsequence in the range [i,j].
derive the relation from [i,j-1] and [i+1,j] and [i+1,j-1]
- i>j dp[i,j,x]=0
- i==j, dp[i,j,x]=1 s[i]=x, otherwise 0.
- i<j
  s[i]!=s[j] dp[i,j,x]=dp[i,j-1,x]+dp[i+1,j,x]-dp[i+1,j-1,x]
  s[i]==s[j]=x, dp[i,j,x]=sum(dp[i+1,j-1,c])+2 //we add x and xx.
 since we need all dp[i,j,c] c from 0 to 3, the loop shall be inside.
rating: 5
->>

<<-1143. longest common subsequence
two strings.
very typical dp problem. 
- lcs
- edit distance.
there are quite a few variation of this problem.

### longest increasing sequence

<<-1671. Minimum Number of Removals to Make Mountain Array
approach: check each index and get the LIS and then back from right to get the LIS.
subject: dp,longest increasing subsequence Oï¼ˆN^2) or O(nlogn)
level: 3
->>

<<-1691. Maximum Height by stacking cuboids
stack cuboids: width<=prev width, length<=prev width, height<=prev height
return the max height.
- each cuboid has 3 orientations
- sort the cube individually, making the height the biggest
- sort the cubes according to width (smallest)
- apply LIS dp 
->>

### strategy game

<<-1690. Stone game VII
each turn remove the left or rightmost stone, and the score is the sum of the remaining.
minimize the difference.
approach: maximize the score for a and b. applying prefix sum and get the scores easily and choose left or right and solve two smaller subproblem.
->>

### reverse thinking
<<-312. Burst Balloons
burst a balloon, and get the score: product of left and right and the balloon.
idea: choose i as the last balloon to burst and its left and right are virtual balloon with value 1. And then balloon i becomes the right and left for two subproblem.
- top down: is more straightforward.
- bottom up: loop over all left and right will not work, but we need to do one balloon, 2...until n balloons. (base case is one balloon left)
->>
 
### build from previous solution.
<<-1687. Delivering boxes from storage to ports
problem: 
- boxes are given in array with weight and destination port.
- ship limited by max number of boxes and max weight.
- order shall be the given order.
- must return to storage at the end.
- even on the ship and the deliver shall be made in order.
Intuition: dp, since you have a lot of options, and each options will affect the later options.
using some greedy approach: 
- neighboring same port order will only have one trip.
- load as many as possible boxes on ship with the restrictions
- add ith item, and pop out oldest to satisfy restrictions (greedy)
- if the popped one is the same with our oldest, keep popping (greedy)
->>

<<- 1641 Count Sorted Vowel Strings 
given length n.
- dp[i,j] represents number of sorted vowel string ending with char j. the previous char shall be <=curr char. dp[i,j]+=dp[i-1,k] k<=j.
- backtracking

<<-1639	Number of Ways to Form a Target String Given a Dictionary    		38.9%	Hard	
a list of dictionary words, and a target string. You can choose a char from kth column, if you used it, then all left side cannot be used.
return number of ways to form the target.
for each column, find the hashmap (histogram)
then apply dp: dp[i,j] we used length i for target and j columns in dictionary
two options: use j column or not use it.
->>

### bitmask dp
bitmask dp: typical usage the number of elements is very limited and 2^n can fit in a integer.

<<-1659	Maximize Grid Happiness    		29.1%	Hard	
problem: given a grid, and number of introvert and number of extrovert. introvert starts with 120 and lose 30 for each neighbor and extrovert starts with 40 and gain 20 for each neighbor. find the max happiniess.
The critical part is to realize that the current choice only depends on previous n placements. 
using dp with bitmask. top down is easier.
dp state is defined by current position, intro used, extro used, previous n cells intromask, previous n cells extromask. 5d dp.
level: 5
->>



### greedy
<<-1686. Stone game IV
problem: stone are valued differently, A will take first. Who will win.
greedy approach: suppose we have two stones (a,b),(c,d).
if A take a, then B take d. difference a-d
if A take c, then B take b. difference c-b
which A shall take? we shall maximize difference a-d>c-b->a+b>c+d.
so we sort by a+b.
->>


<<-1647. Minimum Deletions to Make Character Frequencies Unique
get the occurrence for each char and count each number's frequency in map.
then choose the largest and delete a char to make it single.
->>

<<-1675. Minimize Deviation in Array
odd number can *2, even number can /2. return the min value of max-min.
since odd can change to even only once, we can change all to even, and then only divide is allowed.
Greedy: reduce the max even by half and evaluate the difference. Since we need both the max and the min, sorting or set is more suitable than priority_queue.
if the max is odd, we stop. You cannot make it smaller.
subject: greedy, heap.
level: 4
->>

<<-1673. Find the most competitive subsequence
problem: find the min subsequence with length = k.
approach: greedy approach: use the first n-k minimum for the first element and then discard the elements till the min (including). using priority_queue O(nlogn) or monotonic deque O(n) or monotonic stack. deque is easier.
subject: deque or stack, monotonic
level: 4
->>

<<-1665	Minimum Initial Energy to finish tasks
problem: each task with required and minimam energy. find the total minimum energy
approach: greedy, sort using min-req and then add all. (we complete the more saved energy task first)
level: 4
->>

<<-1663	Smallest string with a given numeric value
problem: a-z represent 1-26, the sum of all chars is the numeric value. given k (value) and n (length), return the smallest string
approach: greedy, based on all 'a' and replace from right as much as 'z'to 'a'
level: 3
->>

### binary search
<<-1631. Path with minimum effort

effort for a route is the max absolute difference between two consecutive steps.
- binary search + bfs/dfs/union-find..
- dijkstra (greedy + heap)
->>

<<-1648	Sell Diminishing-Valued Colored Balls    		30.4%	Medium	
sell prices=number of balls in same color.
so greedy approach we shall sell the highest volume ball first.
binary search the ball volume until we flatten all high volume ball.
->>
<<-1674. Min moves to make array complimentary
problem: A[i]+A[n-1-i] are all the same. using [1,limit] to replace any number, and find the number of replace. (note all elements <=limit and >=1, this is a critical information), very hard question!
Analysis: from brutal force (we need do each pair for all the targets, and then we can use optimization using difference array to reduce O(n) to O(1) (the curve is always 2s,1s,0s,1s,2s, using difference we only need to record 5 changing point). also binary search can also do it with less memory requirement.
subject: difference array and prefix sum.
level: 5
->>

### backtracking

return all poosible palindrome partitioning.
typical backtracking
->>

problem: given an array of integer and m customer orders, each order is number of integers. Each order shall give the same integer.
check if it is possible to fulfill the order.
important: try order from largest to smallest. (sort the array is useless since it keeps changing). If the highest order is not able fulfill, then it is done (prune)
->>

<<-1681. Minimum Incompatibility
problem: divide into k sets, each set cannot contain duplicate number, incompatibility=max-min for each set. find the min sum of incompatibility.
- backtracking: but it will find all permutations. using set to avoid revisit.
a very tricky backtracking problem.
also a bitmask dp problem.
->>

### bfs
<<-1654	Minimum Jumps to Reach Home    		28.0%	Medium	
a line with forbidden position. given a and b. you can jump forward by a, or jump backward with b. You cannot jump backward twice in a row. cannot jump to forbidden position.
given position x, return the min number of jumps to home (at position 0)
bfs: with two status. either from right or from left.
need store position and direction also, the visited array.
->>
### union-find
<<-1632. Rank transform of a matrix
mxn matrix. rank matrix: smallest element in its row and column shall be 1. smaller value smaller rank. rank shall be as small as possible.
greedy approach: 
- start from smallest element, there could be multiples.
-

- approach 3: equivalent to find the intersection node of two linked list. (brilliant)
->>

<<-1676. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree IV
now given a list of nodes, find their LCA
approach 1: using 2 node's lca and reduce by half. O(mnlogm)

<<-644	Maximum Average Subarray II    		32.5%	Hard	
problem: subarray length>=k and find the max subarray average.
subject: binary search, double with greedy.
approach: subarray length =k to n and we can get the max average for each length.
sum(Ai)/j=average->sum(Ai)=j*average->Sum(Ai-Average)
Sum(Ai-Average)>0 then we know we can increase it. otherwise, we shall decrease it.
this leads to a binary search approach.
To check if the array can get more or less than target average:
- Sum(Ai-target) can be achieved using prefix sum.
- we keep the 0 to i-k minimum sum and prefix sum. If prefix sum>min sum, then we know we can get average > target.

reservoir sampling:
Choose k entries from n numbers. Make sure each number is selected with the probability of k/n
Basic idea:
Choose 1, 2, 3, ..., k first and put them into the reservoir.
For k+1, pick it with a probability of k/(k+1), and randomly replace a number in the reservoir.
For k+i, pick it with a probability of k/(k+i), and randomly replace a number in the reservoir.
Repeat until k+i reaches n
Proof:
For k+i, the probability that it is selected and will replace a number in the reservoir is k/(k+i)
For a number in the reservoir before (let's say X), the probability that it keeps staying in the reservoir is
P(X was in the reservoir last time) Ã— P(X is not replaced by k+i)
= P(X was in the reservoir last time) Ã— (1 - P(k+i is selected and replaces X))
= k/(k+i-1) Ã— ï¼ˆ1 - k/(k+i) Ã— 1/kï¼‰
= k/(k+i)
When k+i reaches n, the probability of each number staying in the reservoir is k/n
Example
Choose 3 numbers from [111, 222, 333, 444]. Make sure each number is selected with a probability of 3/4
First, choose [111, 222, 333] as the initial reservior
Then choose 444 with a probability of 3/4
For 111, it stays with a probability of
P(444 is not selected) + P(444 is selected but it replaces 222 or 333)
= 1/4 + 3/4*2/3
= 3/4
The same case with 222 and 333
Now all the numbers have the probability of 3/4 to be picked

- sliding: each index in A can overlap with another index in B, provide the offset is i-j.
- so we accumulate each index difference and the max is the answer.
A = [[1,1,0],[0,1,0],[0,1,0]]-->LA=[0,1,4,7]
B = [[0,0,0],[0,1,1],[0,0,1]]-->LB=[4,5,8]

find triplet i<j<=k, so that arr[i]^...arr[j-1]==arr[j]^...arr[k]
very good question. for triplets we generally need two hashmaps.
brutal force: O(N^3)
using prefix xor: for each j check left and right O(N^2)
O(N):
- xor similar to sum, we can use prefix xor.
- equivalent: from i to k, we get xor=0 (since k>i so we at least have 2 elements included)
- once we found [i,k], what would be the number of triplets? (j can from i+1 to k, which is k-i)
- however the relation is not easy:
   - assuming current prefix we know number of same prefix (from hashmap), for example at i1,i2,i3
   - then we can get: k-i1+k-i2+k-i3--->k*3-(i1+i2+i3)-->
   - we can have two hashmap, one is the histogram for xor value, one is for accumulate the i.

- just like a mountain, each time we bring down a layer with k elements with the highest (top K)
- we can use pq to do this.
- the problem using this approach: we do not know left or right to include.

another approach from smallest:
we start from the min, and remove one occurrence min,min+1,...min+k-1
and repeat this. each time we remove the min.
using map to do this.
this approach does not have two direction dilemma.

- note A[i] as min is included for max at j>i.
- A[i] as max: dp[i]=(A[i]-A[i-1])*2^0+(A[i]-A[i-2])*2^1+......(A[i]-A[0])*2^(i-1)
dp[i]=A[i]*(2^i-1)-[A[i-1]+A[i-2]*2^1+....+A[0]*2^(i-1)]
dp[i+1]=A[i+1]*[2^(i+1)-1]-[A[i]+A[i-1]*2^1+.....+A[0]*2^i]
dp[i+1]-2*dp[i]=A[i+1]*(2^(i+1)-1)-A[i]*(2^(i+1)-2)-A[i]
dp[i+1]-2*dp[i]=(A[i+1]-A[i])*(2^(i+1)-1)

we only need to count current number as min, 2^i, as max 2^(n-i-1).
min shall be negative and max shall be positive.

<<-1. Imagine you are given a real file system, how will you search files? DFS or BFS ?
In general, BFS will use more memory then DFS. However BFS can take advantage of the locality of files in inside directories, and therefore will probably be faster
->>
<<-2. If the file content is very large (GB level), how will you modify your solution?
In a real life solution we will not hash the entire file content, since it's not practical. Instead we will first map all the files according to size. Files with different sizes are guaranteed to be different. We will than hash a small part of the files with equal sizes (using MD5 for example). Only if the md5 is the same, we will compare the files byte by byte
->>
<<-3. If you can only read the file by 1kb each time, how will you modify your solution?
This won't change the solution. We can create the hash from the 1kb chunks, and then read the entire file if a full byte by byte comparison is required.

What is the time complexity of your modified solution? What is the most time consuming part and memory consuming part of it? How to optimize?
Time complexity is O(n^2 * k) since in worse case we might need to compare every file to all others. k is the file size

How to make sure the duplicated files you find are not false positive?
We will use several filters to compare: File size, Hash and byte by byte comparisons.

<<-810. Chalkboard XOR game.
given a list of non-negative numbers. take turn to erase one number. If he causes the xor of all remaining elements to be 0, he loses. If starts with 0, he wins. return who is the winner.
bit operations: 
- if xor=0, then first player wins.
- otherwise, erase a number which is different from current xor, leaving a nonzero xor to the other side. Odd length will leave a non-zero to the other side.
