a selection of problems
according to difficulty:
dp, greedy, tree, stack
heap, trie, graph
dfs, bfs, recursive, backtrack
hashmap, string, array, union-find

we are not covering math.


dp:
dp problem generally is hard if we cannot think it clear. The overlapping problems we need try dp first.
we need build intuition to commonly seen type of problems.
