number of zeros totally depends on the number of factor of 2 and 5
number of 2 is always > number of 5
so we need just count number of 5s

```cpp
    int trailingZeroes(int n) {
       //counter number of 5s 
        int n5s=0;
        for(int i=1;i<=n/5;i++)
        {
            n5s++;
            int t=i;
            while(t%5==0) {t/=5;n5s++;}
        }
        return n5s;
    }
```

to speed:
we can get n/5+n/25+n/5^3+n/5^4 to avoid the loop
