## C#, wpf, .net
.net runtime environment for cross-platform similar to java virtual machine
compile in need at runtime (JIT)
CLR and directX.

c#:
- no pointer and memory management
- no .h file
- data type
- type casting
- console IO
- operators
- math
- string
- file system
- class methods: static, virtual, abstract, override, 
- class: public/private/protected/internal
- inheritance
- polymorphism
- interface and abstract

WPF:
- separate GUI and business logic
- xaml.
- gui elements
- dependency property
- routed events
- resources
- data binding

## OOD:
data encapsulation: information hiding
inheritance: extend and reuse
interface: defer the implementation
polymorphism

- define class from conceptual diagram
- identify attributes
- uses design pattern
- defining framework if applicable (reuse a lot of code)
- identify persistent object or data

## OOD design pattern
creational:
- abstract factory
- builder: move constructor to a class
- singleton: ensure only one instance

structural:
- adapter: convert output format to another format input
- bridge: mxn combination -> m+n (two separate classes)
- composite: tree structure (use object as a data member)
- decorator (wrapper): alter class behavior by adding wrapper.
- facade: a simple interface for only usable methods to use a large module.
- flyweight (cache): save common data in cache for different objects
- proxy: a placeholder for another object allowing to perform action before or after it (lazy evaluation, credit card)

behavior:
- chain of responsibility
- iterator
- momento: snapshot (create the meta data of the object)
- finite state: create new class for each state (context class), behavior uses a separate class.
- template
- command: request object, (invoker, command, execute, receiver)
- mediator (controller)
- observer (listener, event subscriber)
- visitor: without changing many classes structure, add a visitor class to achieve it by using the object reference

## software development methodolgy (software project management or sdlc (life cycle))
guidlines and workflow

- agile (scrum, crystal, feature driven, xp (extreme programming)
 to minimize risk (such as bugs, cost overruns, and changing requirements) when adding new functionality
 In all agile methods, teams develop the software in iterations that contain mini-increments of the new functionality
 
 xp (extreme programming) is one agile method:
 - communication: team communication
 - simplicity: only do the requirements
 - feedback: get feedback and revise
 - courageï¼š courage to accept changes, feedbacks...
 - respect
 
plan-collaborate-delivery (review + revise)
iterative approach adding new functionality.

- minimze risk, customer (or from other division) voice is heard at every step.
- could be inefficient (each function must be fully completed to get user feedback)

- devops (development and operate)
DevOps deployment centers on organizational change that enhances collaboration between the departments responsible for different segments of the development life cycle, such as development, quality assurance, and operations.

this is most similar to what we are doing
smooth the process from development to operate..
often combine with waterfall (hybrid method)
plan-code-build-test-release-deploy-operate-monitor-plan...
devops aims to automate continuous deployment to ensure everything goes smoothly and reliably.
a pipe line structure

- waterfall:
not an iterative process, but a rigid linear process
requirements-> design-> implementation -> verification -> maintenance
Projects with clear objectives and stable requirements can best use the waterfall method

rapid application development

## soft skill
amazon 14 leadership principle
customer obsession
ownership
invent and simplify
are right a lot
learn and be curious
hire and develop the best
inisist on the highest standard
think big
bias for action
frugality
earn trust
dive deep
deliver results

STAR method: situation, task, action, results
stories:
why this company and this job?
weakness: I am bad at giving opinion to supervisor.
difficult customer: 
example 1: customer requests to add a ratio factory
example 2: simplify the discharge workflow and shift to software side. (simplify)
example 3: revise doppler profile to discharge measurement
example 4: revise some modules using ood (ownership)
example 5: bittrue
example 6: check_config
example 7: touchscreen (invent and simplify)
example 8: learn to give opinion to boss
example 9: noise rating: earn trust
example 10: mistake, given inaccurate information
example 11: make decision without data support: customer on sea test
example 12: give top performer more space and make their work more quality
example 13: insist highest standard: GUI
example 14: cfi algorith revision
example 15: bias for action: dicom
example 16: calculated risk (project management, most challenging)
example 17: customer bidding (against deadline, negotiation, resources)
example 18: touchscreen (learn and be curious), opengl, opencv
example 19: the debate on the discharge scheme (disagree and commit)
example 20: dicom to add an engineer to do some research work.

## question to ask
- about company information:
number of employee, departments, business..
- about company culture and hierarchy
- financial and history
- regular day of sde
- work pattern of sde
- expectation on this role
