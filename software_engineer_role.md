gamma scientific - software engineer role.

## c++ new features

coroutine: suspend, wait, resume
concept
initializer
lambda function
range based loop
likely and unlikely
capture this (reference or value)
constexpr
consteval
threads
chrono
enum
nullptr
auto
smart pointer
array

## C#, wpf, .net
.net runtime environment for cross-platform similar to java virtual machine
compile in need at runtime (JIT)
CLR and directX.

c#:
- no pointer and memory management
- no .h file
- data type
- type casting
- console IO
- operators
- math
- string
- file system
- class methods: static, virtual, abstract, override, 
- class: public/private/protected/internal
- inheritance
- polymorphism
- interface and abstract

WPF:
- separate GUI and business logic
- xaml.
- gui elements
- dependency property
- routed events
- resources
- data binding

## OOD:
data encapsulation: information hiding
inheritance: extend and reuse
interface: defer the implementation
polymorphism

- define class from conceptual diagram
- identify attributes
- uses design pattern
- defining framework if applicable (reuse a lot of code)
- identify persistent object or data

## OOD design pattern
creational:
- abstract factory
- builder: move constructor to a class
- singleton: ensure only one instance

structural:
- adapter: convert output format to another format input
- bridge: mxn combination -> m+n (two separate classes)
- composite: tree structure (use object as a data member)
- decorator (wrapper): alter class behavior by adding wrapper.
- facade: a simple interface for only usable methods to use a large module.
- flyweight (cache): save common data in cache for different objects
- proxy: a placeholder for another object allowing to perform action before or after it (lazy evaluation, credit card)

behavior:
- chain of responsibility
- iterator
- momento: snapshot (create the meta data of the object)
- finite state: create new class for each state (context class), behavior uses a separate class.
- template
- command: request object, (invoker, command, execute, receiver)
- mediator (controller)
- observer (listener, event subscriber)
- visitor: without changing many classes structure, add a visitor class to achieve it by using the object reference

## software development methodolgy (software project management or sdlc (life cycle))
guidlines and workflow

- agile (scrum, crystal, feature driven, xp (extreme programming)
plan-collaborate-delivery (review + revise)
iterative approach adding new functionality
- minimze risk, customer voice is heard at every step.
- could be inefficient (each function must be fully completed to get user feedback)

- devops (development and operate)
this is most similar to what we are doing
smooth the process from development to operate..

- waterfall:
not an iterative process, but a rigid linear process
requirements-> design-> implementation -> verification -> maintenance

rapid application development

## soft skill
amazon 14 leadership principle
customer obsession
ownership
invent and simplify
are right a lot
learn and be curious
hire and develop the best
inisist on the highest standard
think big
bias for action
frugality
earn trust
dive deep
deliver results

STAR method: situation, task, action, results
stories:
why this company and this job?
weakness: I am bad at giving opinion to supervisor.
difficult customer: 
example 1: customer requests to add a ratio factory
example 2: simplify the discharge workflow and shift to software side. (simplify)
example 3: revise doppler profile to discharge measurement
example 4: revise some modules using ood (ownership)
example 5: bittrue
example 6: check_config
example 7: touchscreen (invent and simplify)
example 8: learn to give opinion to boss
example 9: noise rating: earn trust
example 10: mistake, given inaccurate information
example 11: make decision without data support: customer on sea test
example 12: give top performer more space and make their work more quality
example 13: insist highest standard: GUI
example 14: cfi algorith revision
example 15: bias for action: dicom
example 16: calculated risk (project management, most challenging)
example 17: customer bidding (against deadline, negotiation, resources)
example 18: touchscreen (learn and be curious), opengl, opencv
example 19: the debate on the discharge scheme (disagree and commit)
example 20: dicom to add an engineer to do some research work.

## question to ask
- about company information:
number of employee, departments, business..
- about company culture and hierarchy
- financial and history
- regular day of sde
- work pattern of sde
- expectation on this role
