### Easy
905. sort array by parity
832. flipping image: stl reverse
561. Array Partition I: min pair sum, sort
922. Sort Array By Parity II
867. Transpose Matrix: A[i,j]=a[j,i]


### Medium
950. Reveal Cards In Increasing Order
reverse build the cards

442. Find All Duplicates in an Array
mark the number seen as negative, then those not marked is duplicates (will marked twice)

695. Max Area of Island
dfs or bfs from any nodes
dfs: remember to mark it visited.

238. Product of Array Except Self
left product and right product, two direction methodology

495. Teemo Attacking
need subtract those overlaps

667. Beautiful Arrangement II
1,k+1,2,k,3,k-1,4,k-2....

565. Array Nesting
use visited array, since every nested array will form a cycle. if a node is visited, it is not needed
769. Max Chunks To Make Sorted
split and sort, then connect and the whole array is sorted, return the max chunks
compare with the sorted array. If the two has same hash, then it is a segment
216. Combination Sum III
1-9, k numbers combination sum to n
dfs with backtrace. don't forget to pop out the solved node
78. Subsets
power subsets corresponds to n-bit from 0 to 1111...1
835. Image Overlap
max overlap
