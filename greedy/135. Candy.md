### Problem Summary
There are N children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

Each child must have at least one candy.
Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.
What is the minimum candies you must give?

### Analysis
example [1,0,2] you need given 2,1,2 candies to each.
- each one at least have one candy, initialize to 1
- left to right scan, if rating > previous one, we need add one candy
- right to left scan, if rating > previous one (behind it), we need check if we need add one.

thus we guarantee the left and right side. this is more likely a dp solution

```cpp
    int candy(vector<int>& ratings) {
        int ans=0;
        int n=ratings.size();
        vector<int> can(n,1);
        //from left to right
        for(int i=1;i<n;i++) if(ratings[i]>ratings[i-1]) can[i]=can[i-1]+1;
        for(int i=n-2;i>=0;i--) if(ratings[i]>ratings[i+1]) can[i]=max(can[i],can[i+1]+1);
       
        return accumulate(can.begin(),can.end(),0);
    }
```
