### Problem Summary
remove duplicate letters from string so that every char occurs only once. return the smallest string remaining

### Analysis

naive approach:
We can safely store the information in a map of char vs its index list.
find the first smallest char who has larger chars followed, and this char is used and removed from the map.
reduce the problem to smaller size.
once the char is chosen, all previous index shall be removed.
```cpp
    string removeDuplicateLetters(string s) {
        //create a map for each character
        map<char,vector<int>> freq;
        for(int i=0;i<s.size();i++) freq[s[i]].push_back(i);
//greedy choice: the leftmost char shall have an index smaller than all other larger char's max index, 
//this letter shall be as small as possible
        string ans;
        auto it=freq.begin();
        bool found=0;
        int nchar=freq.size();
        while(ans.size()<nchar)
        {
            found=1;
            for(auto it1=freq.begin();it1!=freq.end();it1++)
            {
                if(it1==it) continue;
                if(it->second[0]>it1->second.back()) {it++;found=0;break;}
            }
            if(found) 
            {
                int ind=it->second[0];
                ans+=it->first;
                freq.erase(it);
                for(auto it1=freq.begin();it1!=freq.end();it1++) //remove all index smaller than ind
                {
                    auto it2=lower_bound(it1->second.begin(),it1->second.end(),ind);
                    it1->second.erase(it1->second.begin(),it2);
                }
                it=freq.begin();
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
```    

Optimization
 If we think about this problem intuitively, you would sort of go from the beginning of the string and start removing one if there is still the same character left and a smaller character is after it.  Given "bcabc", when you see a 'b', keep it and continue with the search, then keep the following 'c', then we see an 'a'. Now we get a chance to get a smaller lexi order, you can check if after 'a', there is still 'b' and 'c' or not. We indeed have them and "abc" will be our result.
```java
public String removeDuplicateLetters(String s) {
    Stack<Character> stack = new Stack<>();
    int[] count = new int[26];
    char[] arr = s.toCharArray();
    for(char c : arr) count[c-'a']++;
    
    boolean[] visited = new boolean[26];
    for(char c : arr) 
    {
        count[c-'a']--;
        if(visited[c-'a']) continue;
        
        while(!stack.isEmpty() && stack.peek() > c && count[stack.peek()-'a'] > 0) 
        {
            visited[stack.peek()-'a'] = false;
            stack.pop();
        }
        stack.push(c);
        visited[c-'a'] = true;
    }
    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
    for(char c : stack) {sb.append(c); }
    return sb.toString();
}
```
