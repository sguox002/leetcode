### Problem Summary
Given N and a number array, check the min numbers to be added into the array to get the sum from 1 to n
input array is sorted

example:
nums = [1, 2, 4, 13, 43] and n = 100
1 covers 1
1,2: covers 1,2,3
1,2,4: covers 1,2,3,4,5,6,7
missing 8, add 8, it can covers up to 15
1,2,4,8,13 covers up to 28 (13+15)
missing 29, add 29
1,2,4,8,13,29, covers up to 28+29=57
1,2,4,8,13,29,43, covers up to 100

so if previous m element can sum to [1,M]. If M+1 is not covered, we shall add it

```cpp
    int minPatches(vector<int>& nums, int n) {
        //the fastest way to go to n without leaving out any number
        //if the smaller subproblem  solves from 1 to m, then add a number m+1, it solves the problem from 1 to 2m+1
        //the greedy choice is the smaller subproblem's sum+1
         long miss = 1, added = 0, i = 0;
         while (miss <= n) 
         {
            if (i < nums.size() && nums[i] <= miss) 
            {
                miss += nums[i++];
            } 
            else 
            {
                miss += miss;
                added++;
            }
        }
        return added;
    }
```
