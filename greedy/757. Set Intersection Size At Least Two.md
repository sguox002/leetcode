### Problem Summary
An integer interval [a, b] (for integers a < b) is a set of all consecutive integers from a to b, including a and b.

Find the minimum size of a set S such that for every integer interval A in intervals, the intersection of S with A has size at least 2.

### Analysis
- we can sort the intervals according to its end
- the segment shall cover the first segment for at least two element to the end, the last segment from the start.
- iterate all segments: 
  (1) If there is no number in this interval being chosen before, we pick up 2 biggest number in this interval. (the biggest number have the most possibility to be used by next interval)
  (2) If there is one number in this interval being chosen before, we pick up the biggest number in this interval.
  (3) If there are already two numbers in this interval being chosen before, we can skip this interval since the requirement has been fulfilled.

```cpp
    int intersectionSizeTwo(vector<vector<int>>& intervals) {
        sort(intervals.begin(), intervals.end(), [](vector<int>& a, vector<int>& b) 
        {
            return a[1] < b[1] || (a[1] == b[1] && a[0] > b[0]); 
        });
        int n = intervals.size(), ans = 0, p1 = -1, p2 = -1;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) 
        {
            if (intervals[i][0] <= p1) continue;// current p1, p2 works for intervals[i]
            if (intervals[i][0] > p2) // Neither of p1, p2 works for intervals[i]
            {
                ans += 2;
                p2 = intervals[i][1];// replace p1, p2 by ending numbers
                p1 = p2-1;
            }
            else //only p2 works: start in the range [p1,p2]
            {
                ans++;
                p1 = p2;
                p2 = intervals[i][1];
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
```

Note: the problem asks for a set not a single interval, for example, [[1,2],[9,10]] it will return [1,2,9,10] the length is 4
