### Problem Summary
N couples labelled as 0,1,....2*N-1, couples shall sit together. Return the min number of swaps

### Approach
union find using cyclic permutation based on group theory can be applied to find the connected groups (the value and the index)
key observations:
- if we divide each number by 2, we get the group id for all couples
- the final state: position 2i and 2i+1 must have the same group id
- assume a group has i and j, i!=j, then we need swap:
  1. keep i, and swap j with the next i (this at least fix i)
  2. keep j, and swap i with the next j (this is equivalent to above)
  3. thus every time we fix the current group (also may fix some group behind)
we get the following greedy solution:

```cpp
    int minSwapsCouples(vector<int>& row) {
        for(int i=0;i<row.size();i++) row[i]/=2; //making couple the same number
        int cnt=0;
        for(int i=0;i<row.size();i+=2)
        {
            if(row[i]!=row[i+1]) 
            {
                auto it=find(row.begin()+i+2,row.end(),row[i]);
                swap(*it,row[i+1]);
                cnt++;
            }
        }
        return cnt;
    }
```

- the complexity is O(N^2) since every time we need to search for the next
- O(N): create a index array to record each number's position and we exactly know each group's partner and we swap that. Then we do not need to use find. Be careful when we swap two nodes, the index array shall also be swapped.
```java
function minSwapsCouples(row) {
  const pos = {};
  for (let i = 0; i < row.length; i++) {
    pos[row[i]] = i;
  }

  let count = 0;
  for (let i = 1; i < row.length; i += 2) {
    while ((row[i]^1) !== row[i-1]) {
      let idx = pos[row[i]^1]^1;
      [row[i], row[idx]] = [row[idx], row[i]];
      count++;
    }
  }
  return count;
}
```
