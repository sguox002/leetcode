1710. Maximum Units on a Truck
<em>
You are assigned to put some amount of boxes onto one truck. You are given a 2D array boxTypes, where boxTypes[i] = [numberOfBoxesi, numberOfUnitsPerBoxi]:

numberOfBoxesi is the number of boxes of type i.
numberOfUnitsPerBoxi is the number of units in each box of the type i.
You are also given an integer truckSize, which is the maximum number of boxes that can be put on the truck. You can choose any boxes to put on the truck as long as the number of boxes does not exceed truckSize.

Return the maximum total number of units that can be put on the truck.
</em>

sort by unit number

```cpp

    int maximumUnits(vector<vector<int>>& boxTypes, int truckSize) {
        int ans=0;
        sort(begin(boxTypes),end(boxTypes),[](vector<int>& a,vector<int>& b){
            return a[1]>b[1];
        });
        int nbox=0;
        for(int i=0;i<boxTypes.size();i++){
            while(nbox<truckSize && boxTypes[i][0]){
                nbox++,ans+=boxTypes[i][1];
                boxTypes[i][0]--;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
```

1711. Count Good Meals
<em>
A good meal is a meal that contains exactly two different food items with a sum of deliciousness equal to a power of two.

You can pick any two different foods to make a good meal.

Given an array of integers deliciousness where deliciousness[i] is the deliciousness of the i​​​​​​th​​​​​​​​ item of food, return the number of different good meals you can make from this list modulo 109 + 7.

Note that items with different indices are considered different even if they have the same deliciousness value.

dp

```cpp
    int countPairs(vector<int>& deliciousness) {
        int mod=1e9+7;
        int n=deliciousness.size();
        unordered_map<int,int> mp;
        long ans=0;
        for(int i: deliciousness){
            for(int j=0;j<=21;j++){
                int sum=1<<j;
                if(mp.count(sum-i)){
                    ans+=mp[sum-i];
                    ans%=mod;
                }
            }
            mp[i]++;
        }
        return ans;

1712. Ways to Split Array Into Three Subarrays
<em>
A split of an integer array is good if:

The array is split into three non-empty contiguous subarrays - named left, mid, right respectively from left to right.
The sum of the elements in left is less than or equal to the sum of the elements in mid, and the sum of the elements in mid is less than or equal to the sum of the elements in right.
Given nums, an array of non-negative integers, return the number of good ways to split nums. As the number may be too large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

binary search on prefix sum array
```cpp
    int mod=1e9+7;
    int waysToSplit(vector<int>& nums) {
        int tsum=accumulate(begin(nums),end(nums),0);
        int n=nums.size();
        vector<int> prefix(n+1);
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++) prefix[i+1]=prefix[i]+nums[i];
        //better using dp
        //vector<int> dp(n+1); //number of ways to choose i the ending of the left
        //if we choose the left, the remaining is a two 
        int lsum=0;
        long ans=0;
        for(int i=0;i<n-2 && prefix[i+1]<=tsum/3;i++){
            //we are solving tsum-lsum into two parts
            int lsum=prefix[i+1],rsum=tsum-lsum;
            //b>=lsum b+c=tsum-a, b<=(tsum-a)/2
            auto it=lower_bound(begin(prefix)+i+2,end(prefix)-1,2*lsum); //b>=lsum, mid at least start here.
            auto it1=upper_bound(it,end(prefix)-1,lsum+rsum/2); 
            ans+=it1-it;
            ans%=mod;
        }
        return ans;        
    }

1713. Minimum Operations to Make a Subsequence
<em>
You are given an array target that consists of distinct integers and another integer array arr that can have duplicates.

In one operation, you can insert any integer at any position in arr. For example, if arr = [1,4,1,2], you can add 3 in the middle and make it [1,4,3,1,2]. Note that you can insert the integer at the very beginning or end of the array.

Return the minimum number of operations needed to make target a subsequence of arr.

A subsequence of an array is a new array generated from the original array by deleting some elements (possibly none) without changing the remaining elements' relative order. For example, [2,7,4] is a subsequence of [4,2,3,7,2,1,4] (the underlined elements), while [2,4,2] is not.

longest common sequence -> convert to index -> longest increasing subsequence
in O(nlogn)

```cpp
    int minOperations(vector<int>& target, vector<int>& arr) {
        unordered_map<int, int> mp;
        for(int i=0;i<target.size();i++){
            mp[target[i]]=i;
        }
        vector<int> A;//remove unused numbers
        for(int i: arr){
            if(mp.count(i)) A.push_back(mp[i]);
        }
        return target.size() - lengthOfLIS(A);
    }

    int lengthOfLIS(vector<int>& nums) {
        vector<int> piles;
        for(int i=0; i<nums.size(); i++) {
            auto it = lower_bound(piles.begin(), piles.end(), nums[i]);
            if (it == piles.end())
                piles.push_back(nums[i]);
            else
                *it = nums[i];
        }
        return piles.size();
	}
```
