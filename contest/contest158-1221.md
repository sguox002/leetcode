### 1221. Split a String in Balanced Strings3 (**)
Balanced strings are those who have equal quantity of 'L' and 'R' characters.

Given a balanced string s split it in the maximum amount of balanced strings.

Return the maximum amount of splitted balanced strings.

using stack

### 1222. Queens That Can Attack the King (**)
On an 8x8 chessboard, there can be multiple Black Queens and one White King.

Given an array of integer coordinates queens that represents the positions of the Black Queens, and a pair of coordinates king that represent the position of the White King, return the coordinates of all the queens (in any order) that can attack the King.
idea: same row/col/diagonal/anti-diagonal and direct contect with the king
brutal force is fine. find the king position and extend 8 directions.

### 1223. Dice Roll Simulation (****)
A die simulator generates a random number from 1 to 6 for each roll. You introduced a constraint to the generator such that it cannot roll the number i more than rollMax[i] (1-indexed) consecutive times. 

Given an array of integers rollMax and an integer n, return the number of distinct sequences that can be obtained with exact n rolls.

Two sequences are considered different if at least one element differs from each other. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

typical dp problem:
n = 2, rollMax = [1,1,2,2,2,3]
two rolls, 1 roll 1 time, 2, 1 time, 3, 2 times, 4, 2 times, 5: 2 times, 6: 3 times
cannot appear 11, 22 (two dices) so 6*6-2=34
or:
dice 1 roll 1, dice 2 5 options: 1x5
dice 1 roll 2, dice 2 5 options: 1x5
dice 1 roll 3, dice 2 6 options: 1x6
dice 1 roll 4, dice 2 6 options: 1x6
dice 1 roll 5, dice 2 6 options: 1x6
dice 1 roll 6, dice 2 6 options: 1x6
dp[n][k] n dices, roll number k, answer is the sum over k.

base case: n=1, since max is [1,15] so dp[1][i]=1
idea: first calculate the non-repeated cases, then add the constraints
non-repeated: dp[i][j]+=dp[i-1][k], k=1 to 6 j!=k, there is analytical for this.
repeated: dp[i][j]+=dp[i-rmax[j]][j] why?
actually this is a 3d dp problem with repeat 1,2,3,4,....rmax. (rmax<n need processing)
```cpp
    int dieSimulator(int n, vector<int>& rollMax) {
        int mod = 1e9 + 7;
        vector<vector<vector<int>>> dp(n, vector<vector<int>>(6, vector<int>(16, 0)));
        for(int i = 0; i < 6; ++i) {
            dp[0][i][1] = 1;
        }
        for(int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
            for(int j = 0; j < 6; ++j) {
                // calculate dp[i][j][1] = sum(dp[i - 1][except j][1 to rollMax[j]])
                for(int k = 0; k < 6; ++k) {
                    if(k == j) { continue; }
                    for(int m = 1; m <= rollMax[k]; ++m) {
                        dp[i][j][1] = (dp[i][j][1] + dp[i - 1][k][m]) % mod;
                    }
                }
                
                // calculate dp[i][j][2] to dp[i][j][rollMax[j]]
                for(int m = 2; m <= rollMax[j]; ++m) {
                    dp[i][j][m] = dp[i - 1][j][m - 1];
                }
            }
        }
        
        int answer = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < 6; ++i) {
            for(int j = 1; j <= rollMax[i]; ++j) {
                answer = (answer + dp[n - 1][i][j]) % mod;
            }
        }
        return answer;
    }
```
	
### 1224. Maximum Equal Frequency (***)
Given an array nums of positive integers, return the longest possible length of an array prefix of nums, such that it is possible to remove exactly one element from this prefix so that every number that has appeared in it will have the same number of occurrences.

If after removing one element there are no remaining elements, it's still considered that every appeared number has the same number of ocurrences (0).

hashmap
one by one to build the map and check if it is valid, if valid update the max len.
a bit tricky checking valid: convert to hashset, it shall have two elements.
- more than 2 elements, invalid
- if a==1 and b>1 valid 
- if b-a==1 valid (for example 3,4, we can remove 1 from 4)
```cpp
    int maxEqualFreq(vector<int>& nums) {
        //remove one can be single or among multiple of them
        //also need prefix
        unordered_map<int,int> mp;
        int ans=0;
        for(int i=0;i<nums.size();i++){
            mp[nums[i]]++;
            if(checklen(mp)) 
                ans=max(ans,i+1);
        }
        return ans;
    }
    int checklen(unordered_map<int,int>& mp){
        unordered_set<int> ms;
        for(auto t: mp)
            ms.insert(t.second);
        
        if(ms.size()!=2) return 0;
        int a=*ms.begin(),b=*(++ms.begin());
        if(a>b) swap(a,b);
        if(a==1 && b>1) return 1;
        if(b-a==1) return 1;
    }
```
this problem shall be rated as medium instead of hard.
