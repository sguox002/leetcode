1688. Count of Matches in Tournament
<em>
You are given an integer n, the number of teams in a tournament that has strange rules:

If the current number of teams is even, each team gets paired with another team. A total of n / 2 matches are played, and n / 2 teams advance to the next round.
If the current number of teams is odd, one team randomly advances in the tournament, and the rest gets paired. A total of (n - 1) / 2 matches are played, and (n - 1) / 2 + 1 teams advance to the next round.
Return the number of matches played in the tournament until a winner is decided.
</em>

```cpp
    int numberOfMatches(int n) {
        int ans=0;
        while(n>1){
            ans+=n/2;
            n=(n+1)/2;
        }
        return ans;
    }
```

1689. Partitioning Into Minimum Number Of Deci-Binary Numbers
<em>
A decimal number is called deci-binary if each of its digits is either 0 or 1 without any leading zeros. For example, 101 and 1100 are deci-binary, while 112 and 3001 are not.

Given a string n that represents a positive decimal integer, return the minimum number of positive deci-binary numbers needed so that they sum up to n.
</em>

greedy: digits all reduce to 1 or 0, so the max number of transformation is the largest digit.

```cpp
    int minPartitions(string n) {
        int ans=0;
        char mx=0;
        for(char c: n)
            mx=max(mx,c);
        return mx-'0';
    }
```

1690. Stone Game VII
<em>
Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.

There are n stones arranged in a row. On each player's turn, they can remove either the leftmost stone or the rightmost stone from the row and receive points equal to the sum of the remaining stones' values in the row. The winner is the one with the higher score when there are no stones left to remove.

Bob found that he will always lose this game (poor Bob, he always loses), so he decided to minimize the score's difference. Alice's goal is to maximize the difference in the score.

Given an array of integers stones where stones[i] represents the value of the ith stone from the left, return the difference in Alice and Bob's score if they both play optimally.
</em>

It is essentially to maxmize the score, so it is same as before.

```cpp
    int dp[1000][1000][2];//={};
    int stoneGameVII(vector<int>& stones) {
        //alice remove the min of two ends, bob remove the max of two ends
        int n=stones.size();
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            for(int j=i;j<n;j++) dp[i][j][0]=dp[i][j][1]=INT_MIN;
        }
        vector<int> prefix(n+1);
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++) prefix[i+1]=prefix[i]+stones[i];
        int ans=helper(prefix,stones,0,n-1,0);
        //print(n);
        return ans;
    }
    int helper(vector<int>& prefix,vector<int>& stones,int l,int r,int op){
        if(l>=r) return 0;
        if(dp[l][r][op]!=INT_MIN) return dp[l][r][op];
        int ans=0; //maximize the difference
		int rmleft=prefix[r+1]-prefix[l+1];
		int rmright=prefix[r]-prefix[l];
		ans=max(rmleft-helper(prefix,stones,l+1,r,op^1),rmright-helper(prefix,stones,l,r-1,op^1));
        return dp[l][r][op]=ans;
    }
```	

Actually the op is not needed and we can reduce it to 2d dp.

It is found that memset does not work and I do not why.

1691. Maximum Height by Stacking Cuboids

<em>
Given n cuboids where the dimensions of the ith cuboid is cuboids[i] = [widthi, lengthi, heighti] (0-indexed). Choose a subset of cuboids and place them on each other.

You can place cuboid i on cuboid j if widthi <= widthj and lengthi <= lengthj and heighti <= heightj. You can rearrange any cuboid's dimensions by rotating it to put it on another cuboid.

Return the maximum height of the stacked cuboids.
</em>

during contest, I did not notice the height requirement, which is a lesson.

approach:
- sort each cube so that height is the max. (greedy)
- sort the array of boxes --> LIS problem

```cpp
    int maxHeight(vector<vector<int>>& A) {
        for (auto& a : A)
            sort(begin(a), end(a));
        A.push_back({0, 0, 0});
        sort(begin(A), end(A));
        int n = A.size(), res = 0;
        vector<int> dp(n);
        for (int j = 1; j < n; ++j)
            for (int i = 0; i < j; ++i)
                if (A[i][0] <= A[j][0] && A[i][1] <= A[j][1] && A[i][2] <= A[j][2]) {
                    dp[j] = max(dp[j], dp[i] + A[j][2]);
                    res = max(res, dp[j]);
                }
        return res;
    }
```
