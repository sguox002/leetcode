1805. Number of Different Integers in a String
<em>
You are given a string word that consists of digits and lowercase English letters.

You will replace every non-digit character with a space. For example, "a123bc34d8ef34" will become " 123  34 8  34". Notice that you are left with some integers that are separated by at least one space: "123", "34", "8", and "34".

Return the number of different integers after performing the replacement operations on word.

Two integers are considered different if their decimal representations without any leading zeros are different.
</em>

The key is to use string to represent the number.
- use hashset to eliminate duplicates
- remove leading zeros.

```
    int numDifferentIntegers(string word) {
        unordered_set<string> ms;
        word+='a';
        char c=-1;
        string num="";
        for(char c: word){
            if(c>='0' && c<='9') {
                num+=c;
            }
            else{
                if(num.size()){
                    int i=0;
                    while(i<num.size() && num[i]=='0') i++;
                    if(i==num.size()) ms.insert("0");
                    else ms.insert(num.substr(i));
                }
                num="";
            }
        }
        return ms.size();
    }
```

1806. Minimum Number of Operations to Reinitialize a Permutation
<em>
You are given an even integer n​​​​​​. You initially have a permutation perm of size n​​ where perm[i] == i​ (0-indexed)​​​​.

In one operation, you will create a new array arr, and for each i:

If i % 2 == 0, then arr[i] = perm[i / 2].
If i % 2 == 1, then arr[i] = perm[n / 2 + (i - 1) / 2].
You will then assign arr​​​​ to perm.

Return the minimum non-zero number of operations you need to perform on perm to return the permutation to its initial value.
</em>

simulate the process

```
    int reinitializePermutation(int n) {
        vector<int> perm(n),arr(n);
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++) perm[i]=i;
        int ans=0;
        arr=perm;
        bool valid=1;
        do{
            valid=1;
            for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
                if(i%2==0) arr[i]=perm[i/2];
                else arr[i]=perm[n/2+(i-1)/2];
                if(arr[i]!=i) valid=0;
            }
            ans++;
            if(valid) return ans;
            perm=arr;
        }while(valid==0);
        return 0;
    }
```

1807. Evaluate the Bracket Pairs of a String
<em>
You are given a string s that contains some bracket pairs, with each pair containing a non-empty key.

For example, in the string "(name)is(age)yearsold", there are two bracket pairs that contain the keys "name" and "age".
You know the values of a wide range of keys. This is represented by a 2D string array knowledge where each knowledge[i] = [keyi, valuei] indicates that key keyi has a value of valuei.

You are tasked to evaluate all of the bracket pairs. When you evaluate a bracket pair that contains some key keyi, you will:

Replace keyi and the bracket pair with the key's corresponding valuei.
If you do not know the value of the key, you will replace keyi and the bracket pair with a question mark "?" (without the quotation marks).
Each key will appear at most once in your knowledge. There will not be any nested brackets in s.

Return the resulting string after evaluating all of the bracket pairs.
</em>

```
    string evaluate(string s, vector<vector<string>>& knowledge) {
        unordered_map<string,string> mp;
        for(auto p: knowledge) mp[p[0]]=p[1];
        string ans,key;
        int cnt=0;
        for(char c: s){
            if(c=='(') cnt++,key="";
            else if(c==')') {
                cnt--;
                if(mp.count(key)) ans+=mp[key];
                else ans+="?";
            }
            else {
                if(cnt==0) ans+=c;
                else key+=c;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
```

1808. Maximize Number of Nice Divisors
<em>
You are given a positive integer primeFactors. You are asked to construct a positive integer n that satisfies the following conditions:

The number of prime factors of n (not necessarily distinct) is at most primeFactors.
The number of nice divisors of n is maximized. Note that a divisor of n is nice if it is divisible by every prime factor of n. For example, if n = 12, then its prime factors are [2,2,3], then 6 and 12 are nice divisors, while 3 and 4 are not.
Return the number of nice divisors of n. Since that number can be too large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

Note that a prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers. The prime factors of a number n is a list of prime numbers such that their product equals n.

 
</em>
convert to equivalent math problem: break into sum and makes the product the largest (there is a similar problem)
key: greedy. use examples to discover the math. 
idea: 
<=4: the product is n.
n>4: except n%3==1, we need move one 3 out to get a 4.

binary power to get 3^n%mod

```
    int maxNiceDivisors(int primeFactors) {
        //sum=primeFactors max the product
        //break into 3,3,3....until 4
        long ans=0;
        int mod=1e9+7;
        int prod=1;
        if(primeFactors<=4) ans=primeFactors;
        else{
            if(primeFactors%3==1)
                ans=4l*mypow(3.0,(primeFactors)/3-1,mod)%mod;
            else {
                ans=mypow(3.0,(primeFactors)/3,mod);
                if(primeFactors%3) ans*=primeFactors%3;
            }
            
            ans%=mod;
        }
        return ans;
    }
    int mypow(int a,int n,int mod){
        if(!n) return 1;
        if(n%2) return (long)a*mypow((long)a*a%mod,n/2,mod)%mod;
        return mypow((long)a*a%mod,n/2,mod)%mod;
    }
```
