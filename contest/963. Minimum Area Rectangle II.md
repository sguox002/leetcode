### Problem Summary
given a list of points, find the min rectangle area. If no rectangle, return 0

### idea
Naive: (N^4)
all combinations of 4 points to see if it can combine a rectangle.
we need first determine:
- the 4 points can form a rectangle
- how to calculate the area from the 4 points
This involves some math and is not easy to figure out.
Better use vector or complex number.
suppose we have p0,p1,p2,p3 check if it is a rectangle.
vector p0p1, p0p2, p0p3: check if there exist perpendicular vectors. 
- Actually P3 is not needed. If we have p0p1 perpendicular to p0p2 and their amplitude is the same, we are able to find the other point.
- furthermore we only need two points to form a vector and its perpendicular vector is also known (two options: we can calculate from equations, these involves double and find in set, which is a mess.)
- hashset to store the vectors (but how to calculate hash function?) or we can use set
using above we can improve the efficiency greatly.

So from the idea to correct code there is still a long way to go.

This is a much better approach:
It uses the vector as the diagnonal axis, the center and the distance combined and compose a string and use it as the key, the value is the two point pairs.
So all those vectors with the same center and length is now under the same key. (a rectangle does not require the two diagonal axes are perpendicular)

### implementation
```cpp
    double minAreaFreeRect(vector<vector<int>>& points) {
        unordered_map<string,vector<vector<int>>> mp; //key vs diagonal axis (two points' index)
        int n=points.size();
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
        {
            for(int j=i+1;j<n;j++)
            {
                int dx=points[i][0]-points[j][0];
                int dy=points[i][1]-points[j][1];
                long dist2=dx*dx+dy*dy;
                double cx=(points[i][0]+points[j][0])*0.5;
                double cy=(points[i][1]+points[j][1])*0.5;
                string s=to_string(dist2)+": "+to_string(cx)+", "+to_string(cy);
                //cout<<s<<endl;
                mp[s].push_back({i,j});
            }
        }
        double min_area=1e15;
        for(auto it=mp.begin();it!=mp.end();it++)
        {
            if(it->second.size()<2) continue;
            //there could be multiple rectangle inside
            //now we have 4 points in diagonal, p0-p2 diagonal, p1-p3 diagonal
            vector<vector<int>>& vrect=it->second;
            for(int i=0;i<vrect.size();i++)
            {
                for(int j=i+1;j<vrect.size();j++)
                {
                    int p0=vrect[i][0],p2=vrect[i][1];
                    int p1=vrect[j][0],p3=vrect[j][1];
                    int dx=points[p0][0]-points[p1][0];
                    int dy=points[p0][1]-points[p1][1];
                    long long dist01=dx*dx+dy*dy;
                    dx=points[p0][0]-points[p3][0];
                    dy=points[p0][1]-points[p3][1];
                    long long dist03=dx*dx+dy*dy;
                    double area=sqrt(double(dist01)*dist03);
                    min_area=min(min_area,area);
                }
            }
        }
        return min_area==1e15?0:min_area;
    }
```

Note:
-  with same center and same distance, there could be multiple rectangles (imagine the 4 points on the circle and the diagnonal are the diameter), so we need to find the min inside it.
