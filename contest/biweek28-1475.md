### 1475. Final Prices With a Special Discount in a Shop

Given the array prices where prices[i] is the price of the ith item in a shop. There is a special discount for items in the shop, if you buy the ith item, then you will receive a discount equivalent to prices[j] where j is the minimum index such that j > i and prices[j] <= prices[i], otherwise, you will not receive any discount at all.

Return an array where the ith element is the final price you will pay for the ith item of the shop considering the special discount.

- brutal force O(N^2)
- stack: find next smaller- O(N)

```cpp

    vector<int> finalPrices(vector<int>& A) {
        vector<int> stack;
        for (int i = 0; i < A.size(); ++i) {
            while (stack.size() && A[stack.back()] >= A[i]) {
                A[stack.back()] -= A[i];
                stack.pop_back();
            }
            stack.push_back(i);
        }
        return A;
    }

### 1476. Subrectangle Queries

mplement the class SubrectangleQueries which receives a rows x cols rectangle as a matrix of integers in the constructor and supports two methods:

1. updateSubrectangle(int row1, int col1, int row2, int col2, int newValue)

Updates all values with newValue in the subrectangle whose upper left coordinate is (row1,col1) and bottom right coordinate is (row2,col2).
2. getValue(int row, int col)

Returns the current value of the coordinate (row,col) from the rectangle

- brutal force:
```cpp
    vector<vector<int>> rect;
    SubrectangleQueries(vector<vector<int>>& rectangle) {
        rect=rectangle;
    }
    
    void updateSubrectangle(int row1, int col1, int row2, int col2, int newValue) {
        for(int i=row1;i<=row2;i++){
            for(int j=col1;j<=col2;j++)
                rect[i][j]=newValue;
        }
    }
    
    int getValue(int row, int col) {
        return rect[row][col];
    }
```
or we can record the updates and then start from newest to oldest updates and see what region is in.

### 1477. Find Two Non-overlapping Sub-arrays Each With Target Sum

Given an array of integers arr and an integer target.

You have to find two non-overlapping sub-arrays of arr each with sum equal target. There can be multiple answers so you have to find an answer where the sum of the lengths of the two sub-arrays is minimum.

Return the minimum sum of the lengths of the two required sub-arrays, or return -1 if you cannot find such two sub-arrays

this is two subproblem: find subarray sum=target sum and two non-overlapped region with sum of length minimized.

we start from left to right and get the left min length satisfying subarray sum==target
then get the right to left the right min length satisfying subarray sum==target.

subarray sum==target using hashmap to record the latest index.
a little bit similar to dp.

```cpp
    int minSumOfLengths(vector<int>& arr, int target) {
        unordered_map<int,int> mp0,mp1; //prefix sum vs index, suffix sum and then meet
        int n=arr.size();
        mp0[0]=-1;
        mp1[0]=n;
        
        int pre=0,post=0,i=0,j=n-1;
        int ans=INT_MAX;
        vector<int> left(n,INT_MAX),right(n,INT_MAX);//min length
        int lmin=INT_MAX,rmin=INT_MAX;
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            pre+=arr[i];
            if(mp0.count(pre-target)){
                lmin=min(lmin,i-mp0[pre-target]);
            }
            mp0[pre]=i;
            left[i]=lmin;            
        }
        mp0.clear();
        mp0[0]=n;
        pre=0;
        for(int i=n-1;i>0;i--){
            pre+=arr[i];
            if(mp0.count(pre-target)){
                rmin=min(rmin,mp0[pre-target]-i);
            }
            mp0[pre]=i;
            if(rmin<INT_MAX && left[i-1]<INT_MAX) ans=min(ans,rmin+left[i-1]);
        }
        return ans<INT_MAX?ans:-1;
	}		
```


### 1478. Allocate Mailboxes

Given the array houses and an integer k. where houses[i] is the location of the ith house along a street, your task is to allocate k mailboxes in the street.

Return the minimum total distance between each house and its nearest mailbox.

The answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit signed integer.	

dp: dp[i,k] for i houses with k mailboxes
k=1 is the base case
current house can combine up to k-1 to i for an additional group
however the base case is hard to get the min.

The base: given a array and 1 mailbox, what is the min distance?
brutal force: try all possible position in the house range, that would be too large O(N^2)

if two houses: any place from i to j can be OK since the distance is the same
if three houses: the median would be the best place, because lleft and right gives the same sum anywhere, but the mid will have 0 if we put on median.

```cpp
    int minDistance(vector<int>& houses, int k) {
        //divide into k groups and the sum of distance is minimized
        //dp? dp[i,k] represent to min sum for i houses and k mailbox
        int n=houses.size();
        sort(begin(houses),end(houses));
        vector<vector<long>> dp(n+1,vector<long>(k+1,INT_MAX));
        dp[0][0]=0;
        //when mailbox>=houses
        for(int g=1;g<=k;g++) {
            for(int i=0;i<=g;i++) dp[i][g]=0;
        }
        
        for(int g=1;g<=k;g++){ //mailbox, always keep i>g
            for(int i=g+1;i<=n;i++){ //number of houses
                dp[i][g]=dp[i-1][g-1]; //use it as a new segment
                for(int j=i-1;j>=g;j--){ //number of groups, need keep g-1 houses 
                    dp[i][g]=min({dp[i][g],dp[j-1][g-1]+mindist(houses,j-1,i-1)});
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[n][k]==INT_MAX?-1:dp[n][k];
    }
    int mindist(vector<int>& houses,int i,int j){
        int ans=0;
        while(i<j) ans+=houses[j--]-houses[i++];
        return ans;
    }
```

- I struggled for a long time due to the following details
- always keep the i,j >=g satisfied since other are basecases
- use long to avoid the int-max problem
- base case k=1, the answer is the accumulation of pair difference
