1624. Largest Substring Between Two Equal Characters
<em>
Given a string s, return the length of the longest substring between two equal characters, excluding the two characters. If there is no such substring return -1.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.
</em>

idea: save the first index for each char and update the max length
```cpp
    int maxLengthBetweenEqualCharacters(string s) {
        vector<int> ind(26,-1);
        int ans=-1;
        for(int i=0;i<s.size();i++){
            //cout<<s[i]<<" "<<ind[s[i]-'a']<<endl;
            if(ind[s[i]-'a']>=0) {
                ans=max(ans,i-ind[s[i]-'a']-1);
            }
            else ind[s[i]-'a']=i;
        }
        return ans;
    }
```

1625. Lexicographically Smallest String After Applying Operations

<em>
You are given a string s of even length consisting of digits from 0 to 9, and two integers a and b.

You can apply either of the following two operations any number of times and in any order on s:

Add a to all odd indices of s (0-indexed). Digits post 9 are cycled back to 0. For example, if s = "3456" and a = 5, s becomes "3951".
Rotate s to the right by b positions. For example, if s = "3456" and b = 1, s becomes "6345".
Return the lexicographically smallest string you can obtain by applying the above operations any number of times on s.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b (of the same length) if in the first position where a and b differ, string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b. For example, "0158" is lexicographically smaller than "0190" because the first position they differ is at the third letter, and '5' comes before '9'.

</em>

intuition: 
bfs or dfs
we've seen quite a few several operations either to get smallest one or the min steps to target
mostly we can use bfs to do it. or dp sometimes.


bfs is better to put all candidates in the queue. (since each operation the number of transform is limited)

```cpp
    string findLexSmallestString(string s, int a, int b) {
        //bfs/dfs
        unordered_set<string> v;
        queue<string> q;
        int n=s.size();
        b%=n;
        b=n-b;
        q.push(s);
        v.insert(s);
        string ans=s;
        while(q.size()){
            int sz=q.size();
            while(sz--){
                string t=q.front();
                q.pop();
                ans=min(ans,t);
                //apply rotate first it will end 
                string tt=t;
                while(1) {
                    rotate(begin(tt),begin(tt)+b,end(tt));
                    if(v.count(tt)) break;
                    v.insert(tt);
                    q.push(tt);
                }
                //applying add
                tt=t;
                while(1){
                    add(tt,a);
                    if(v.count(tt)) break;
                    v.insert(tt);
                    q.push(tt);
                }
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
    void add(string& s,int a){
        for(int i=1;i<s.size();i+=2){
            int d=s[i]-'0';
            d+=a;
            d%=10;
            s[i]='0'+d;
        }
    }
```


1626. Best Team With No Conflicts
<em>
You are the manager of a basketball team. For the upcoming tournament, you want to choose the team with the highest overall score. The score of the team is the sum of scores of all the players in the team.

However, the basketball team is not allowed to have conflicts. A conflict exists if a younger player has a strictly higher score than an older player. A conflict does not occur between players of the same age.

Given two lists, scores and ages, where each scores[i] and ages[i] represents the score and age of the ith player, respectively, return the highest overall score of all possible basketball teams.
</em>

approach:
- sort the team according to score.
- then problem becomes a dp problem:
current member can be added to previous group if its age is smaller than previous member.
- the answer is max(use[n],notuse[n])
so we define two status:
use[n]: nth person is used, the max score
notuse[n]: nth person is not used, the max score
note: use or notuse is not arbitrary, but need to include all valid members.

```cpp
    int bestTeamScore(vector<int>& scores, vector<int>& ages) {
        //age smaller score shall be smaller-->get the max sum
        int ans=0;
        //if we choose higher score with youner ages, then the age is restricted
        int n=scores.size();
        vector<vector<int>> vpair;
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++) vpair.push_back({scores[i],ages[i]});
        sort(rbegin(vpair),rend(vpair)); //sort by scores descending
        vector<int> use(n+1),notuse(n+1);
        use[1]=vpair[0][0];//dp
        notuse[1]=0;
        
        for(int i=1;i<n;i++){ //need has age non-ascending order
            int s=vpair[i][0],a=vpair[i][1];
            //we can choose use or not use 
            //use we shall append to previous age >=it
            for(int j=0;j<=i;j++){
                if(j==0 || vpair[j-1][1]>=a) use[i+1]=max(use[i+1],use[j]+s);
            }
            notuse[i+1]=max(use[i],notuse[i]);
            
        }
        return max(use[n],notuse[n]);
    }
```	


1627. Graph Connectivity With Threshold

<em>
We have n cities labeled from 1 to n. Two different cities with labels x and y are directly connected by a bidirectional road if and only if x and y share a common divisor strictly greater than some threshold. More formally, cities with labels x and y have a road between them if there exists an integer z such that all of the following are true:

x % z == 0,
y % z == 0, and
z > threshold.
Given the two integers, n and threshold, and an array of queries, you must determine for each queries[i] = [ai, bi] if cities ai and bi are connected (i.e. there is some path between them).

Return an array answer, where answer.length == queries.length and answer[i] is true if for the ith query, there is a path between ai and bi, or answer[i] is false if there is no path.

 </em>
 
Union-find.
```cpp
    vector<int> parent;
    vector<bool> areConnected(int n, int threshold, vector<vector<int>>& queries) {
        vector<bool> ans(queries.size(),0);
        if(threshold==0) return vector<bool>(queries.size(),1);
        parent.resize(n+1);
        for(int i=1;i<=n;i++) parent[i]=i;
        vector<bool> v(n+1);
        for(int i=threshold;i<=n;i++){
            if(v[i]) continue;
            v[i]=1;
            for(int j=2*i;j<=n;j+=i){
                int pi=findp(i),pj=findp(j);
                if(__gcd(i,j)>threshold && pi!=pj){
                    parent[pi]=pj;
                }
            }
        }
        int i=0;
        for(auto q: queries){
            int pi=findp(q[0]),pj=findp(q[1]);
            ans[i++]=(pi==pj);
        }
        return ans;
    }
    int findp(int i){
        while(i!=parent[i]){
            parent[i]=parent[parent[i]];
            i=parent[i];
        }
        return i;
    }
```

Note using sieve to preprocess the pairs are critical to avoid TLE.
