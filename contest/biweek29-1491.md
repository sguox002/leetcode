### 1491. Average Salary Excluding the Minimum and Maximum Salary

simple
rating: *
```cpp
    double average(vector<int>& salary) {
        sort(begin(salary),end(salary));
        long sum=accumulate(begin(salary)+1,end(salary)-1,0ll);
        return double(sum)/(salary.size()-2);
    }
```
without sort, we can find min and max, but need only minus once.

### 1492. The kth Factor of n
<em>
Given two positive integers n and k.

A factor of an integer n is defined as an integer i where n % i == 0.

Consider a list of all factors of n sorted in ascending order, return the kth factor in this list or return -1 if n has less than k factors.

```cpp
    int kthFactor(int n, int k) {
        int ans=-1;
        vector<int> f;
        f.push_back(1);
        f.push_back(n);
        for(int i=2;i*i<=n;i++){
            if(n%i==0) {
                f.push_back(i);
                if(i*i!=n) f.push_back(n/i);
            }
        }
        if(f.size()<k) return -1;
        sort(begin(f),end(f));
        return f[k-1];
    }
```

### 1493. Longest Subarray of 1's After Deleting One Element
<em>
Given a binary array nums, you should delete one element from it.

Return the size of the longest non-empty subarray containing only 1's in the resulting array.

Return 0 if there is no such subarray.
</em>

equivalent: find the longest window containing at most one zero.
sliding window: when more than one zero is seen, start a new window.

```cpp
    int longestSubarray(vector<int>& nums) {
        //sliding window with one zero
        //longest window with at most one zero
        int n=nums.size();
        int ans=0;
        int i=0,j=0,pre=-1;
        while(j<n){
            if(nums[j]==0) {
                if(pre>=0){
                    i=pre+1;
                }
                pre=j;
            }
            ans=max(ans,j-i);
            //cout<<i<<" "<<j<<endl;
            j++;
        }
        return ans;
    }
```

### 1494. Parallel Courses II
<em>
Given the integer n representing the number of courses at some university labeled from 1 to n, and the array dependencies where dependencies[i] = [xi, yi]  represents a prerequisite relationship, that is, the course xi must be taken before the course yi.  Also, you are given the integer k.

In one semester you can take at most k courses as long as you have taken all the prerequisites for the courses you are taking.

Return the minimum number of semesters to take all courses. It is guaranteed that you can take all courses in some way.
</em>

- first, we need to recognize this is a dp problem.
- choosing which k courses or how many will affect further choices, indicating this is bitmask dp problem.
- top down approach

```cpp
    int minNumberOfSemesters(int n, vector<vector<int>>& dependencies, int k) {
        //bfs: source nodes first. (no incoming edge)
        vector<int> adj(n);//using bits
        for(auto t: dependencies)
            adj[t[1]-1]|=1<<(t[0]-1);//incoming
        //bitset dp, how do we track the status change?
        int mx=n+1;
        int m=1<<n;
        vector<int> dp(m,mx),cnt(m);//cnt: number of bits set.
        for(int i=1;i<m;i++) cnt[i]=cnt[i/2]+(i&1);
        dp[0]=0; //there is no course
        for(int state=0;state<m;state++) {
            //find all courses without pre
            //if(dp[state]<=n){
                int nstate=0;
                for(int i=0;i<n;i++){ //each course
                    if(state & (1<<i)) continue; //if course i is taken
                    if( (adj[i]&state)==adj[i]){ //all pre are taken
                        nstate|=1<<i;
                    }
                }
            //these courses can be taken in this semester or next semester
            //suppose we have l courses and at most k courses per semester.
                for(int j=nstate;j>0;j=((j-1) & nstate)){
                    if(cnt[j]<=k) dp[state|j]=min(dp[state|j],dp[state]+1);
                }
            //}
        }
        return dp[m-1];
    }
