### 1184. Distance Between Bus Stops (**)
<em>Problem:

A bus has n stops numbered from 0 to n - 1 that form a circle. We know the distance between all pairs of neighboring stops where distance[i] is the distance between the stops number i and (i + 1) % n.

The bus goes along both directions i.e. clockwise and counterclockwise.

Return the shortest distance between the given start and destination stops.
</em>
idea: it is a cycle, we just compare start-end distance and total-start,end distance, make sure start<end

### 1185. Day of the week (**)
- use built in date functions
- known today's weekday and calculate how many days between given date and today. and %7. We need to know how to get the leap year.

### 1186. Maximum Subarray Sum with One Deletion (****)
<em>Problem:

Given an array of integers, return the maximum sum for a non-empty subarray (contiguous elements) with at most one element deletion. In other words, you want to choose a subarray and optionally delete one element from it so that there is still at least one element left and the sum of the remaining elements is maximum possible.

Note that the subarray needs to be non-empty after deleting one element.
</em>

idea:

- if in the subarray, min>0, we do not remove anything. if <0, then we remove the min.
- also remove the min helps to connect two subarrays
- dp (the max subarray sum is also a dp problem) and we add an extra constraint making it a 2d dp problem:
	- do not delete it: regular max subarray sum
	- delete it: only for negative number.
	- all negatives, return the max.
	
```cpp
    int maximumSum(vector<int>& arr) {
        vector<vector<int>> dp(arr.size(), vector<int>(2, 0)); //dp[i,0] no delete, dp[i,1] delete one element
        dp[0][0]=arr[0]; 
        int res=arr[0];
        for(int i=1;i<arr.size();i++) { 
            dp[i][0]=max(arr[i], dp[i-1][0]+arr[i]); //nodel
            dp[i][1]=max(arr[i], max(dp[i-1][1]+arr[i], dp[i-1][0])); //delete i or not delete i.
            res=max(res, max(dp[i][0], dp[i][1])); 
        }
        return res;
    }
```	
to make it more clear:
```cpp
    int maximumSum(vector<int>& arr) {
		int del=0,nodel=arr[0];
        int res=arr[0];
        for(int i=1;i<arr.size();i++) {
            int v=arr[i];
            del=max({v, del+v, nodel}); //delete i or not delete i: whether we shall connect to previous
			nodel=max(v, nodel+v); //nodel: either we shall connect to previous
            res=max({res, del, nodel}); 
        }
        return res;
    }
```

### 1187. Make Array Strictly Increasing (*****)
<em>Problem:

Given two integer arrays arr1 and arr2, return the minimum number of operations (possibly zero) needed to make arr1 strictly increasing.

In one operation, you can choose two indices 0 <= i < arr1.length and 0 <= j < arr2.length and do the assignment arr1[i] = arr2[j].

If there is no way to make arr1 strictly increasing, return -1.
</em>

Idea:
[1,5,3,6,7],[4,3,1]
sort the arr2 to [1,3,4]
replace 5 with 3, replace 3 with 4->[1,3,4,6,7]

- strictly increasing, so duplicate in arr2 is useless, we can remove those duplicates. and no element can be assigned more than one time.
- dp approach: 
  - first sort arr2 and remove duplicates, now the number of replace is the same as index in arr2
  - now think it is a variation of longest increasing subsequence, but now you can go to the other array
  arr1 = [1,5,3,6,7], arr2 = [1,3,2,4]
  first sort and remove duplicate of arr2=[1,2,3,4]
  1 5 3 6 7
    \  /
  1 2 3 4
  
it is like: find the longest increasing subsequence from arr1: 1,3,6,7 and check if we can fill the missing elements from arr2. The problem is we may have many LIS and we need to check all these combinations.
we can add INT_MIN to the head and INT_MAX to the tail of arr1 to make the base simpler.
using LIS, we only need to calculate the number of changes from j+1 to i-1.
```cpp
	int makeArrayIncreasing(vector<int>& arr1, vector<int>& arr2) {
		set<int> ms(arr2.begin(),arr2.end());
		arr2.clear();
		for(int t: ms) arr2.push_back(t);
		arr1.insert(arr1.begin(),INT_MIN);
		arr1.push_back(INT_MAX);
		int n=arr1.size();
		vector<int> dp(n,INT_MAX);
		dp[0]=0;
		for(int i=1;i<n;i++){
			for(int j=0;j<i;j++){
				if(arr1[i]>arr1[j] && dp[j]<INT_MAX){
				int change=check(arr1,j,i,arr2);
				if(change>=0) dp[i]=min(dp[i],dp[j]+change);
				}
			}
		}
		return dp[n-1]==INT_MAX?-1:dp[n-1];
	}
	//find the change number from start+1 to end-1
	int check(vector<int>& arr1,int start,int end,vector<int>& arr2){
		if(start+1==end) return 0;
		int mn=arr1[start],mx=arr1[end];
		int idx=upper_bound(arr2.begin(),arr2.end(),mn)-arr2.begin();
		int maxcount=end-start-1;
		int endi=idx+maxcount-1;
		if(endi<arr2.size() && arr2[endi]<mx) return maxcount;
		return -1;
	}
```
- it checks if replace all the element from start+1 to end-1 if arr2 has all the elements.
- the check function is quite hard to understand.
