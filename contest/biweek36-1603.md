1603. Design Parking System.
<em>
Design a parking system for a parking lot. The parking lot has three kinds of parking spaces: big, medium, and small, with a fixed number of slots for each size.

Implement the ParkingSystem class:

ParkingSystem(int big, int medium, int small) Initializes object of the ParkingSystem class. The number of slots for each parking space are given as part of the constructor.
bool addCar(int carType) Checks whether there is a parking space of carType for the car that wants to get into the parking lot. carType can be of three kinds: big, medium, or small, which are represented by 1, 2, and 3 respectively. A car can only park in a parking space of its carType. If there is no space available, return false, else park the car in that size space and return true.
</em>

very simple:

```cpp
    vector<int> cap;
    ParkingSystem(int big, int medium, int small) {
        cap.push_back(big);
        cap.push_back(medium);
        cap.push_back(small);
    }
    
    bool addCar(int carType) {
        if(cap[carType-1]>0) {
            cap[carType-1]--;
            return 1;
        }
        return 0;
    }
```

1604. Alert Using Same Key-Card Three or More Times in a One Hour Period

<em>
LeetCode company workers use key-cards to unlock office doors. Each time a worker uses their key-card, the security system saves the worker's name and the time when it was used. The system emits an alert if any worker uses the key-card three or more times in a one-hour period.

You are given a list of strings keyName and keyTime where [keyName[i], keyTime[i]] corresponds to a person's name and the time when their key-card was used in a single day.

Access times are given in the 24-hour time format "HH:MM", such as "23:51" and "09:49".

Return a list of unique worker names who received an alert for frequent keycard use. Sort the names in ascending order alphabetically.

Notice that "10:00" - "11:00" is considered to be within a one-hour period, while "22:51" - "23:52" is not considered to be within a one-hour period.
</em>

approach: using hashmap and sliding window
need sort in time and sort in name.
sliding window either using dq or two pointer.

```cpp
    vector<string> alertNames(vector<string>& keyName, vector<string>& keyTime) {
        set<string> ans;
        unordered_map<string,set<int>> mp;
        for(int i=0;i<keyName.size();i++){
            int t=stoi(keyTime[i].substr(0,2))*60+stoi(keyTime[i].substr(3));
            mp[keyName[i]].insert(t);
        }
        for(auto t: mp){
            deque<int> dq;
            for(int i: t.second){
                while(dq.size()>=2 && dq.front()+60<i) dq.pop_front();
                dq.push_back(i);
                if(dq.size()>=3) ans.insert(t.first);
            }
        }
        return {begin(ans),end(ans)};
    }
```	

1605. Find Valid Matrix Given Row and Column Sums
<em>

You are given two arrays rowSum and colSum of non-negative integers where rowSum[i] is the sum of the elements in the ith row and colSum[j] is the sum of the elements of the jth column of a 2D matrix. In other words, you do not know the elements of the matrix, but you do know the sums of each row and column.

Find any matrix of non-negative integers of size rowSum.length x colSum.length that satisfies the rowSum and colSum requirements.

Return a 2D array representing any matrix that fulfills the requirements. It's guaranteed that at least one matrix that fulfills the requirements exists.
</em>

math problem:
- A[i,j] is bound by the min(row[i],col[j]) (all non-negative)
- greedy choose the max =min(row[i],col[j]) will not break the validness.
sum(rsum)=sum(csum)
when choose min(rsum[i],csum[j]) 
sum(rsum)-min(rsum[i],csum[j]) =sum(csum)-min(rsum[i],csum[j]) 

```cpp
    vector<vector<int>> restoreMatrix(vector<int>& row, vector<int>& col) {
        int m = row.size(), n = col.size();
        vector<vector<int>> A(m, vector<int>(n, 0));
        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0 ; j < n; ++j) {
                A[i][j] = min(row[i], col[j]);
                row[i] -= A[i][j];
                col[j] -= A[i][j];
            }
        }
        return A;
    }
```

1606. Find Servers That Handled Most Number of Requests
<em>
You have k servers numbered from 0 to k-1 that are being used to handle multiple requests simultaneously. Each server has infinite computational capacity but cannot handle more than one request at a time. The requests are assigned to servers according to a specific algorithm:

The ith (0-indexed) request arrives.
If all servers are busy, the request is dropped (not handled at all).
If the (i % k)th server is available, assign the request to that server.
Otherwise, assign the request to the next available server (wrapping around the list of servers and starting from 0 if necessary). For example, if the ith server is busy, try to assign the request to the (i+1)th server, then the (i+2)th server, and so on.
You are given a strictly increasing array arrival of positive integers, where arrival[i] represents the arrival time of the ith request, and another array load, where load[i] represents the load of the ith request (the time it takes to complete). Your goal is to find the busiest server(s). A server is considered busiest if it handled the most number of requests successfully among all the servers.

Return a list containing the IDs (0-indexed) of the busiest server(s). You may return the IDs in any order.
k<=10^5

</em>

brutal force O(N^2) will TLE:

```cpp
    vector<int> busiestServers(int k, vector<int>& arrival, vector<int>& load) {
        vector<int> nextTime(k);
        vector<int> cnt(k),ans;
        int mx=0;
        for(int i=0;i<arrival.size();i++){
            int start=i%k;
            for(int j=start;j<start+k;j++){
                if(nextTime[j%k]<=arrival[i]){
                    cnt[j%k]++;
                    nextTime[j%k]=arrival[i]+load[i];
                    mx=max(mx,cnt[j%k]);
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        for(int i=0;i<k;i++){
            if(cnt[i]==mx) ans.push_back(i);
        }
        return ans;
    }
```	

We need optimize it to O(N) or O(nlogn).
We shall be able to find the next free server using O(logn) time.
The difficulty is after the start sever, there are servers which cannot satisfy the time requirement. 

can we use priority_queue for this?
- start,....start+k-1, we need update all the server id after start.
- expand the server list and unwrap the circular so we can do lower_bound.
- use time,id pair as the pq element. we need time<arrival and id>start.
- min heap

approach: sort the time in the pq, sort the free servers.
this will save some time and will pass the time requirement.

```cpp
    vector<int> busiestServers(int k, vector<int>& arr, vector<int>& lo) {
        set<int> free;
        int n = arr.size();
        for (int i = 0; i < 2*k - 1; i ++)
            free.insert(i);
        vector<int> cnt(k, 0);
        priority_queue<pair<int, int>, vector<pair<int, int>>, greater<>> pq;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i ++)
        {
            int at = arr[i];
            int load = lo[i];
            while (!pq.empty() and pq.top().first <= at)
            {
                auto tt = pq.top();
                int server = tt.second;
                pq.pop();
                free.insert(server);
                free.insert(server + k);
            }
            if (!free.empty()) {
                int server = (*free.lower_bound(i % k)) % k;
                free.erase(server % k);
                free.erase(server % k + k);

                cnt[server] ++;
                pq.push({at + load, server});
            }
        }
        int mv = -1;
        vector<int> res;
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i ++)
        {
            if (cnt[i] > mv)
            {
                mv = cnt[i];
                res = {i};
            }
            else if (cnt[i] == mv)
                res.push_back(i);
        }
        return res;
    }
```
