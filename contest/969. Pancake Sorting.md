### Problem Summary
sorting the array by reverse the first k elements

### Approach
greedy: always move the biggest to the first and move to its sorted position
do not need to consider the special case when it is already in the first position
reverse to find the largest: the input is 1 to n, using this fact to make it more easier.

### code
```cpp
    vector<int> pancakeSort(vector<int> A) {
        vector<int> res;
        int x,i;
        for (x = A.size(); x > 0; --x) {
            for (i = 0; A[i] != x; ++i);
            reverse(A.begin(), A.begin() + i + 1);
            res.push_back(i + 1);
            reverse(A.begin(), A.begin() + x);
            res.push_back(x);
        }
        return res;
    }
```
