In a town, there are N people labelled from 1 to N.  There is a rumor that one of these people is secretly the town judge.

If the town judge exists, then:

The town judge trusts nobody.
Everybody (except for the town judge) trusts the town judge.
There is exactly one person that satisfies properties 1 and 2.
You are given trust, an array of pairs trust[i] = [a, b] representing that the person labelled a trusts the person labelled b.

If the town judge exists and can be identified, return the label of the town judge.  Otherwise, return -1.

### Approach
Be sure to pay attention to special case

```cpp
    int findJudge(int N, vector<vector<int>>& trust) {
        unordered_map<int,int> mp1,mp2;
        for(int i=0;i<trust.size();i++) 
        {
            mp1[trust[i][0]]++;//he trust
            mp2[trust[i][1]]++; //he is trusted
        }
        for(auto it=mp2.begin();it!=mp2.end();it++)
        {
            if(it->second==N-1 && mp1.count(it->first)==0) return it->first;
        }
        if(N==1) return 1;
        return -1;
    }
```

N=1 is the special case. no trust and no trusted.
