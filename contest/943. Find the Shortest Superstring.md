### Problem Summary
Given an array A of strings, find any smallest string that contains each string in A as a substring.

We may assume that no string in A is substring of another string in A.

 
Example 1:

Input: ["alex","loves","leetcode"]
Output: "alexlovesleetcode"
Explanation: All permutations of "alex","loves","leetcode" would also be accepted.
Example 2:

Input: ["catg","ctaagt","gcta","ttca","atgcatc"]
Output: "gctaagttcatgcatc"
 

Note:

1 <= A.length <= 12
1 <= A[i].length <= 20

### Analysis
- equivalent: think it as a graph, max the total sum of overlap, visiting each node once.
- traveling salesman problem

By calculating the total length of si and sj, the problem is the shortest path visiting each node once problem
By calculating the overlap length of si and sj, the problem is the max path (with weight) visiting each node once problem
