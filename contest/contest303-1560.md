### 1560. Most visited sector in a circular track ***
<em>
Given an integer n and an integer array rounds. We have a circular track which consists of n sectors labeled from 1 to n. A marathon will be held on this track, the marathon consists of m rounds. The ith round starts at sector rounds[i - 1] and ends at sector rounds[i]. For example, round 1 starts at sector rounds[0] and ends at sector rounds[1]

Return an array of the most visited sectors sorted in ascending order.

Notice that you circulate the track in ascending order of sector numbers in the counter-clockwise direction (See the first example).
</em>

This is not an easy problem.
idea: 
- maintain an array of each sector's counter and get the max.
- the rounds: a->b we shall make b>a by adding a round to it. (multiple rounds does not matter since it add same to all sectors).
- increase the counter to all sectors between.

```cpp
    vector<int> mostVisited(int n, vector<int>& rounds) {
        vector<int> ans,v(n);
        for(int& i: rounds) i--;
        int pre=rounds[0];
        int mx=0;
        
        for(int i=1;i<rounds.size();i++){
            while(rounds[i]<=rounds[i-1]) rounds[i]+=n;
            for(int j=pre;j<rounds[i];j++) mx=max(mx,++v[j%n]);
            pre=rounds[i];
        }
        
        mx=max(mx,++v[rounds.back()%n]);
        for(auto i=0;i<n;i++) if(v[i]==mx) ans.push_back(i+1) ;
        return ans;
    }
```	
note: do not forget the last one.
actually, according to above analysis:
- the inner side rounds does not matter since the whole rounds make no difference
- we only need to process the first and last.

### 1561. Max number of coins you can get **
<em>
There are 3n piles of coins of varying size, you and your friends will take piles of coins as follows:

In each step, you will choose any 3 piles of coins (not necessarily consecutive).
Of your choice, Alice will pick the pile with the maximum number of coins.
You will pick the next pile with maximum number of coins.
Your friend Bob will pick the last pile.
Repeat until there are no more piles of coins.
Given an array of integers piles where piles[i] is the number of coins in the ith pile.

Return the maximum number of coins which you can have.
</em>
greedy approach: we always choose the min and max and 2nd max.

```cpp
    int maxCoins(vector<int>& piles) {
        //greedy
        sort(begin(piles),end(piles));
        int i=0,n=piles.size(),j=n-1;
        int ans=0;
        while(i<j){
            ans+=piles[j-1];
            i++,j-=2;
        }
        return ans;
    }
```
	

### 1562. Find latest group of size Max ****
<em>
Given an array arr that represents a permutation of numbers from 1 to n. You have a binary string of size n that initially has all its bits set to zero.

At each step i (assuming both the binary string and arr are 1-indexed) from 1 to n, the bit at position arr[i] is set to 1. You are given an integer m and you need to find the latest step at which there exists a group of ones of length m. A group of ones is a contiguous substring of 1s such that it cannot be extended in either direction.

Return the latest step at which there exists a group of ones of length exactly m. If no such group exists, return -1.
</em>

My intuition on this is union-find, but I then thought it is also a binary search problem.
binary search is incorrect because the M group may appear on left, or appear on right, or sometimes disappear and then appear.  Only after I get several wrong answer I realize it.

union find is actually straightforward, we need to keep the group size vs count.
- union find to group consecutives
- maintain each group size
- maintain a reverse map: group size vs count.

```cpp
    vector<int> parent;
    unordered_map<int,int> size,revsize;
    
    int findLatestStep(vector<int>& arr, int m) {
        //union find and get the groups of m
        if(arr.empty()) return -1;
        int n=arr.size();
        vector<bool> v(n+1);
        parent.resize(n+1);
        //revsize[1]=n;//if we have one bit to set.
        for(int i: arr) parent[i]=i,size[i]=1;
        unordered_set<int> ms;
        //revsize[1]=n;//incorrect since we are doing one by one.
        int ans=-1;
        for(int i=0;i<arr.size();i++){
            int cur=arr[i];
            revsize[1]++;//first add current as a disjoint set.
            if(ms.count(cur-1)) merge(cur,cur-1);
            if(ms.count(cur+1)) merge(cur,cur+1);
            
            //check if there is any group==m
            if(revsize[m]>0) ans=i+1;
            ms.insert(cur);
        }
        return ans;
    }
    int findp(int i){
        while(i!=parent[i]){
            parent[i]=parent[parent[i]];
            i=parent[i];
        }
        return i;
    }
    void merge(int i,int j){
        int pi=findp(i),pj=findp(j);
        if(pi!=pj){
            revsize[size[pi]]=max(revsize[size[pi]]-1,0);//the old set disappear
            revsize[size[pj]]=max(revsize[size[pj]]-1,0);//the old set disappear
            parent[pi]=pj;
            size[pj]+=size[pi];
            revsize[size[pj]]++;
            size[pi]=0;
        }
    }
```	
I got more than 7 wrong submission for this!!!

### 1563. Stone game V ***
<em>
There are several stones arranged in a row, and each stone has an associated value which is an integer given in the array stoneValue.

In each round of the game, Alice divides the row into two non-empty rows (i.e. left row and right row), then Bob calculates the value of each row which is the sum of the values of all the stones in this row. Bob throws away the row which has the maximum value, and Alice's score increases by the value of the remaining row. If the value of the two rows are equal, Bob lets Alice decide which row will be thrown away. The next round starts with the remaining row.

The game ends when there is only one stone remaining. Alice's is initially zero.

Return the maximum score that Alice can obtain.
</em>

using top down, and we can get a dp approach using what the problem states.
the only thing is we shall not add the last stone (since we already added before the last).

```cpp
    int stoneGameV(vector<int>& stoneValue) {
        int n=stoneValue.size();
        vector<vector<long>> dp(n,vector<long>(n));
        return helper(stoneValue,0,n-1,dp);
    }
    long helper(vector<int>& stones,int l,int r,vector<vector<long>>& dp){
        if(r==l) return 0;//stones[l];
        if(dp[l][r]>0) return dp[l][r];
        long tsum=accumulate(begin(stones)+l,begin(stones)+r+1,0l);
        long lsum=0;
        long ans=0;
        for(int i=l;i<r;i++){
            lsum+=stones[i];
            if(2*lsum<tsum) ans=max({ans,lsum+helper(stones,l,i,dp)});
            else if(2*lsum==tsum) ans=max({ans,lsum+helper(stones,l,i,dp),lsum+helper(stones,i+1,r,dp)});
            else ans=max({ans,tsum-lsum+helper(stones,i+1,r,dp)});
        }
        return dp[l][r]=ans;
    }
```
