1732. Find the Highest Altitude
<em>There is a biker going on a road trip. The road trip consists of n + 1 points at different altitudes. The biker starts his trip on point 0 with altitude equal 0.

You are given an integer array gain of length n where gain[i] is the net gain in altitude between points i​​​​​​ and i + 1 for all (0 <= i < n). Return the highest altitude of a point.
</em>
```
    int largestAltitude(vector<int>& gain) {
        int ans=0,pre=0;
        for(int i: gain){
            ans=max(ans,pre+=i);
        }
        return ans;
    }
```

1733. Minimum Number of People to Teach
<em>
On a social network consisting of m users and some friendships between users, two users can communicate with each other if they know a common language.

You are given an integer n, an array languages, and an array friendships where:

There are n languages numbered 1 through n,
languages[i] is the set of languages the i​​​​​​th​​​​ user knows, and
friendships[i] = [u​​​​​​i​​​, v​​​​​​i] denotes a friendship between the users u​​​​​​​​​​​i​​​​​ and vi.
You can choose one language and teach it to some users so that all friends can communicate with each other. Return the minimum number of users you need to teach.

Note that friendships are not transitive, meaning if x is a friend of y and y is a friend of z, this doesn't guarantee that x is a friend of z
</em>

correct understand the question is critical
go over all edges and discard those can talk

```
    int minimumTeachings(int n, vector<vector<int>>& languages, vector<vector<int>>& friendships) {
        //understand the problem is important, only one language is taught so that friends can communicate
        //if friends can talk, just ignore them
        //cannot talk, find the language by most people
        unordered_map<int,int> mp;
        int m=languages.size();
        vector<bool> v(m);
        for(auto e: friendships){
            if(!cantalk(languages[e[0]-1],languages[e[1]-1])){ //cannot talk
                v[e[0]-1]=v[e[1]-1]=1;
            }
        }
        int mx=0,nuser=0;
        for(int i=0;i<m;i++){
            if(v[i]){
                nuser+=1;
                for(int l: languages[i]) {
                    mx=max(mx,++mp[l]);
                }
            }
        }
        //cout<<nuser<<" "<<mx<<endl;
        return nuser-mx;
        
    }
    
    bool cantalk(vector<int>& a,vector<int>& b){
        unordered_set<int> ms(begin(a),end(a));
        for(int i:b) if(ms.count(i)) return 1;
        return 0;
    }
```

1734. Decode XORed Permutation
<em>
There is an integer array perm that is a permutation of the first n positive integers, where n is always odd.

It was encoded into another integer array encoded of length n - 1, such that encoded[i] = perm[i] XOR perm[i + 1]. For example, if perm = [1,3,2], then encoded = [2,1].

Given the encoded array, return the original array perm. It is guaranteed that the answer exists and is unique.
</em>

math derive.
```
    vector<int> decode(vector<int>& A) {
        //odd length? 1-n
        //the encoded max = i^j it will not exceed i+j
        //a1,a2,....an, ->a1,(a2^a3=A[1]),(a3^a4=A3)....
        //a1^A[1]^A[3]^...=a1^a2^...^an
        //1^2^...^n^a1^a2^...an=0  -->a1=1^2^...n^A[1]^A[3]^...
        int n = A.size() + 1, a = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i <= n; ++i) {
            a ^= i;
            if (i < n && i % 2 == 1) {
                a ^= A[i];
            }
        }
        vector<int> res = {a};
        for (int a: A) {
            res.push_back(res.back() ^ a);
        }
        return res;
    }        
```

1735. Count Ways to Make Array With Product
<em>
ou are given a 2D integer array, queries. For each queries[i], where queries[i] = [ni, ki], find the number of different ways you can place positive integers into an array of size ni such that the product of the integers is ki. As the number of ways may be too large, the answer to the ith query is the number of ways modulo 109 + 7.

Return an integer array answer where answer.length == queries.length, and answer[i] is the answer to the ith query.
</em>

prime factorization and then calculate the permutation.
assume prod=p1^n1*....*pm^nm m prime factors.
the choice is we can take Ni from each prime factors (Ni from 0 to ni), the remaining shall be combined all together. (but this over count since we might get same result).

- we only need to calculate the number of ways to construct non-1 factors (all other space can fill 1)
- use m identical elements in n positions, the number is C(n,m).

- use approach in 254 factor combinations (does not include 1 and n itself)
- for the prod itself, add n to it.
- for the factor combinations, calculate the combinations
- combination will overflow, have to use modinv.

```cpp
    int mod=1e9+7;
    vector<int> waysToFillArray(vector<vector<int>>& queries) {
        vector<int> ans;
        for(auto q:queries){
            ans.push_back(numWays(q[1],2,{},q[0])+(q[1]==1?1:q[0]));
        }
        return ans;
    }
    //using backtrack to generate all the factor combinations
    int numWays(int n,int start,unordered_map<int,int> mp,int size){
        if(n<start){ //now we get one answer
            return ways(mp,size)%mod;
        }
        long ans=0;//use the number itself
        for(int i=start;i*i<=n;i++){
            if(n%i==0){
                mp[i]++,mp[n/i]++;
                ans+=ways(mp,size)%mod;ans%=mod;
                mp[n/i]--;
                ans+=numWays(n/i,i,mp,size)%mod;ans%=mod;
                mp[i]--;
            }
        }
        //cout<<ans;
        return ans;
    }
    int ways(unordered_map<int,int>& mp,int sz){
        //for(auto t: mp) cout<<"["<<t.first<<" "<<t.second<<"] ";cout<<endl;
        int sum=0;
        for(auto t: mp) sum+=t.second>0;
        if(sum>sz || sum==0) return 0;
        //C(n,m)
        long ans=1;
        for(auto t: mp){
            ans*=comb(sz,t.second);
            sz-=t.second;
            ans%=mod;
        }
        //treat each group as a single element
        //ans*=comb(sz,sum);ans%=mod;
        return ans;
    }
    int comb(int n,int m){
        long ans=1;
        for(int i=1;i<=m;i++){
            ans=ans*(n-i+1)%mod*modinv(i,mod-2,mod);
            ans%=mod;
        }
        return ans;
    }
    long modinv(int a,int n,int p){ //calculate a^-1%p -->a^(p-2)%p
        if(n==0) return 1;
        if(n%2) return a*modinv((long)a*a%p,n/2,p)%p;
        return modinv((long)a*a%p,n/2,p)%p;
    }        
```

still TLE, need optimize:

precalculate the modinv and use reference for the hashmap will effectively improve the efficiency.
