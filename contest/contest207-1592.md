1592. Rearrange Spaces Between Words
<em>
You are given a string text of words that are placed among some number of spaces. Each word consists of one or more lowercase English letters and are separated by at least one space. It's guaranteed that text contains at least one word.

Rearrange the spaces so that there is an equal number of spaces between every pair of adjacent words and that number is maximized. If you cannot redistribute all the spaces equally, place the extra spaces at the end, meaning the returned string should be the same length as text.

Return the string after rearranging the spaces.
</em>

using stringstream and store words in vector and calculate space and spaces after the last one.

```cpp
    string reorderSpaces(string text) {
        stringstream ss(text);
        string w,ans;
        vector<string> vt;
        int len=0;
        while(ss>>w) vt.push_back(w),len+=w.size();
        int nspaces=text.size()-len;
        if(vt.size()==1) {
            ans=vt[0];
            ans.append(text.size()-vt[0].size(),' ');
            return ans;
        }
        //cout<<nspaces<<endl;
        int nadd=nspaces/(vt.size()-1);
        int nend=nspaces%(vt.size()-1);
        for(int i=0;i<vt.size()-1;i++){
            ans+=vt[i];
            ans.append(nadd,' ');
        }
        ans+=(vt.back());
        ans.append(nend,' ');
        return ans;
    }
```

1593. Split a String Into the Max Number of Unique Substrings
<em>
Given a string s, return the maximum number of unique substrings that the given string can be split into.

You can split string s into any list of non-empty substrings, where the concatenation of the substrings forms the original string. However, you must split the substrings such that all of them are unique.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

greedy does not work.
binary search is not easy
backtrack shall be able to do it
dp: not easy to store the status since it depends on previous cut.
backtrack: from 1 char to the whole string as the first step
```cpp
    int maxUniqueSplit(string s) {
        unordered_set<string> ms;
        
        return helper(s,ms);
    }
    int helper(string s,unordered_set<string>& ms){
        int ans=0;
        //if(s.empty()) return 0;
        for(int i=0;i<s.size();i++){
            string cand=s.substr(0,i+1);
            if(ms.count(cand)==0){
                ms.insert(cand);
                //cout<<cand<<" "<<i+1<<endl;
                ans=max(ans,1+helper(s.substr(i+1),ms));
                ms.erase(cand);
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
```

Note: using value passing will TLE.

1594. Maximum Non Negative Product in a Matrix
<em>
You are given a rows x cols matrix grid. Initially, you are located at the top-left corner (0, 0), and in each step, you can only move right or down in the matrix.

Among all possible paths starting from the top-left corner (0, 0) and ending in the bottom-right corner (rows - 1, cols - 1), find the path with the maximum non-negative product. The product of a path is the product of all integers in the grid cells visited along the path.

Return the maximum non-negative product modulo 109 + 7. If the maximum product is negative return -1.

Notice that the modulo is performed after getting the maximum product.
</em>

dp: keep tracking of min and max at the same time.

```cpp
    int maxProductPath(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int m=grid.size(),n=grid[0].size();
        vector<vector<long>> mx(m+1,vector<long>(n+1,-1)),mn(m+1,vector<long>(n+1,INT_MAX));
        mx[0][1]=mx[1][0]=mn[0][1]=mn[1][0]=1;
        for(int i=1;i<=m;i++){
            for(int j=1;j<=n;j++){
                if(grid[i-1][j-1]>=0){
                    mx[i][j]=max(mx[i-1][j],mx[i][j-1])*grid[i-1][j-1];
                    mn[i][j]=min(mn[i-1][j],mn[i][j-1])*grid[i-1][j-1];
                }
                else{
                    mx[i][j]=min(mn[i-1][j],mn[i][j-1])*grid[i-1][j-1];
                    mn[i][j]=max(mx[i-1][j],mx[i][j-1])*grid[i-1][j-1];
                }
            }
        }
        int mod=1e9+7;
        return mx[m][n]<0?-1:mx[m][n]%mod;
    }

1595. Minimum Cost to Connect Two Groups of Points
<em>
You are given two groups of points where the first group has size1 points, the second group has size2 points, and size1 >= size2.

The cost of the connection between any two points are given in an size1 x size2 matrix where cost[i][j] is the cost of connecting point i of the first group and point j of the second group. The groups are connected if each point in both groups is connected to one or more points in the opposite group. In other words, each point in the first group must be connected to at least one point in the second group, and each point in the second group must be connected to at least one point in the first group.

Return the minimum cost it takes to connect the two groups.
size 1 and 2<=12.
</em>

Apparently this is a dp problem with a lot of choices
consider the graph as a matrix, m[i,j] represents the edge cost between i and j. mxn choices. (looks similar to campus bike problem)
our target: all i is connected and all j is connected with the min prices.

The difficulty lies how we represent the requirements in data structure.
bitmask [1<<m][1<<n] and the answer is dp[1<<m-1,1<<n-1]
dp[i,j] represents the min cost using bitset i from group 1 and bitset 2 from group 2. (this does not include information which connects which)
then how do we make the next choices?

above approach is not right.

Instead we use the first group elements with second group bitmask dp[i,mask]
After finishing with the first group, we detect elements in group 2 that are still disconnected, and connect them with the "cheapest" node in the first group

the code below is taken from other's code post:

```cpp
int dp[13][4096] = {};
int dfs(vector<vector<int>>& cost, vector<int> &min_sz2, int i, int mask) {
    if (dp[i][mask]) return dp[i][mask] - 1;    
	int m=cost.size(),n=cost[0].size();
    int res = i >= m ? 0 : INT_MAX;
    if (i >= m){ //finished group 1
        for (auto j = 0; j < n; ++j)
            res += min_sz2[j] * ((mask & (1 << j)) == 0);
	}
    else{
        for (auto j = 0; j < n; ++j)
            res = min(res, cost[i][j] + dfs(cost, min_sz2, i + 1, mask | (1 << j)));
	}
    dp[i][mask] = res + 1;
    return res;
}
int connectTwoGroups(vector<vector<int>>& cost) {
    vector<int> min_sz2(cost[0].size(), INT_MAX);
    for (int j = 0; j < min_sz2.size(); ++j)
        for (int i = 0; i < cost.size(); ++i)
            min_sz2[j] = min(min_sz2[j], cost[i][j]);
    return dfs(cost, min_sz2, 0, 0);
}
```
