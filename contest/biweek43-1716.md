1716. Calculate Money in Leetcode Bank
<em>
Hercy wants to save money for his first car. He puts money in the Leetcode bank every day.

He starts by putting in $1 on Monday, the first day. Every day from Tuesday to Sunday, he will put in $1 more than the day before. On every subsequent Monday, he will put in $1 more than the previous Monday.
Given n, return the total amount of money he will have in the Leetcode bank at the end of the nth day.
<em>

straightforward

```
    int totalMoney(int n) {
        int ans=0;
        for(int i=1;i<=n;i++){
            ans+=(i-1)/7+(i-1)%7+1;
        }
        return ans;
    }
```

1717. Maximum Score From Removing Substrings
<em>
You are given a string s and two integers x and y. You can perform two types of operations any number of times.

Remove substring "ab" and gain x points.
For example, when removing "ab" from "cabxbae" it becomes "cxbae".
Remove substring "ba" and gain y points.
For example, when removing "ba" from "cabxbae" it becomes "cabxe".
Return the maximum points you can gain after applying the above operations on s.
</em>

greedy: use stack to first eliminate high value pairs and then erase low value pairs.

```
    int maximumGain(string s, int x, int y) {
        //using stack
        bool flag=0;
        if(x>y){
            swap(x,y);
            flag=1;
        }
        s+='x';
        string t;
        int ans=0;
        for(int i=0;i<s.size();i++){
            if(s[i]!='a' && s[i]!='b'){ //we need evaluate t
                ans+=score(t,x,y);
                t.clear();
                continue;
            }
            if(flag){
                if(s[i]=='a') s[i]='b';
                else s[i]='a';
            }
            t+=s[i];
        }
        return ans;
    }
    int score(string& t,int x,int y){
        string s;
        int ans=0;
        for(char c: t){
            if(s.size() && c=='a' && s.back()=='b'){
                ans+=y;
                s.pop_back();
            }
            else s+=c;
        }
        int na=0,nb=0;
        for(char c: s){
            if(c=='a') na++;
            else nb++;
        }
        return ans+min(na,nb)*x;
    }
```
this can be simiplified a lot.

1718. Construct the Lexicographically Largest Valid Sequence
<em>
Given an integer n, find a sequence that satisfies all of the following:

The integer 1 occurs once in the sequence.
Each integer between 2 and n occurs twice in the sequence.
For every integer i between 2 and n, the distance between the two occurrences of i is exactly i.
The distance between two numbers on the sequence, a[i] and a[j], is the absolute difference of their indices, |j - i|.

Return the lexicographically largest sequence. It is guaranteed that under the given constraints, there is always a solution.

A sequence a is lexicographically larger than a sequence b (of the same length) if in the first position where a and b differ, sequence a has a number greater than the corresponding number in b. For example, [0,1,9,0] is lexicographically larger than [0,1,5,6] because the first position they differ is at the third number, and 9 is greater than 5.
</em>

backtracking with greedy
greedy: try largest number on first index, if cannot, try 2nd.

```cpp
    vector<int> constructDistancedSequence(int n) {
        //try to fill one by one (index)
        vector<int> ans,t(2*n-1);
        vector<bool> v(n+1);
        //v[1]=1;
        backtrack(0,v,t,ans);
        return ans;
    }
    
    //backtrack using number on this index will be OK
    bool backtrack(int ind,vector<bool>& v,vector<int>& t,vector<int>& ans){
        int used=accumulate(begin(v),end(v),0);
        int n=v.size()-1;
        //for(int i: t) cout<<i<<" ";cout<<endl<<used<<endl;
        if(used==n){
            ans=max(ans,t);
            return 1;
        }
        if(ind>=t.size()){
            return 0;
        }
        if(t[ind]) return backtrack(ind+1,v,t,ans);
        
        for(int i=n;i>=1;i--){
            int add=i>1?i:0;
            if(v[i] || ind+add>=2*n-1 || t[ind+add]) continue;
            v[i]=1;
            t[ind]=t[ind+add]=i;
            if(backtrack(ind+1,v,t,ans)) return 1;
            t[ind]=t[ind+add]=0; //restore
            v[i]=0;
        }
        return 0;
    }
```

1719. Number Of Ways To Reconstruct A Tree
<em>
You are given an array pairs, where pairs[i] = [xi, yi], and:

There are no duplicates.
xi < yi
Let ways be the number of rooted trees that satisfy the following conditions:

The tree consists of nodes whose values appeared in pairs.
A pair [xi, yi] exists in pairs if and only if xi is an ancestor of yi or yi is an ancestor of xi.
Note: the tree does not have to be a binary tree.
Two ways are considered to be different if there is at least one node that has different parents in both ways.

Return:

0 if ways == 0
1 if ways == 1
2 if ways > 1
A rooted tree is a tree that has a single root node, and all edges are oriented to be outgoing from the root.

An ancestor of a node is any node on the path from the root to that node (excluding the node itself). The root has no ancestors.
</em>

critical: understanding the problem correctly: all ancestor-descendent relation pairs shall appear (input is a complete set of this).
