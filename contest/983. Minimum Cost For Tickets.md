### Problem Summary
Given a list of days, we can buy tickets for single day, 7-day and 30-days at different prices. To cover all the days, what is the lowest cost

### Approach
This is a dp problem, can also be combined with two pointer approach
dp[i] is the min cost for the subproblem ending at days[i]

It is:
min(dp[i-1]+cost1,dp[7th]+cost7,dp[30th]+cost30)

```cpp
    int mincostTickets(vector<int>& days, vector<int>& costs) {
        int n=days.size();
        sort(days.begin(),days.end());
        vector<int> dp(n+1);//dp[i] is the min cost ending at ith day
        for(int i=1;i<=n;i++)
        {
            dp[i]=dp[i-1]+costs[0];
            for(int j=i-1;j>0;j--)
            {
                if(days[i-1]-days[j-1]>=30) break;
                dp[i]=min(dp[i],dp[j-1]+costs[2]);
                if(days[i-1]-days[j-1]<7) dp[i]=min(dp[i],dp[j-1]+costs[1]);
            }
        }
        return dp[n];
    }
```
