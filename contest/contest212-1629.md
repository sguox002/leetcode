### 1629. Slowest Key
<em>
A newly designed keypad was tested, where a tester pressed a sequence of n keys, one at a time.

You are given a string keysPressed of length n, where keysPressed[i] was the ith key pressed in the testing sequence, and a sorted list releaseTimes, where releaseTimes[i] was the time the ith key was released. Both arrays are 0-indexed. The 0th key was pressed at the time 0, and every subsequent key was pressed at the exact time the previous key was released.

The tester wants to know the key of the keypress that had the longest duration. The ith keypress had a duration of releaseTimes[i] - releaseTimes[i - 1], and the 0th keypress had a duration of releaseTimes[0].

Note that the same key could have been pressed multiple times during the test, and these multiple presses of the same key may not have had the same duration.

Return the key of the keypress that had the longest duration. If there are multiple such keypresses, return the lexicographically largest key of the keypresses.
</em>

straightforward, get the diff.

```cpp
    char slowestKey(vector<int>& releaseTimes, string keysPressed) {
        char ans=0;
        int mx=0;
        for(int i=0;i<keysPressed.size();i++){
            if(i==0) ans=keysPressed[i],mx=releaseTimes[i];
            else if(mx<=releaseTimes[i]-releaseTimes[i-1]){
                if(mx<releaseTimes[i]-releaseTimes[i-1]) 
                    ans=keysPressed[i],mx=releaseTimes[i]-releaseTimes[i-1];
                else if(ans<keysPressed[i]) ans=keysPressed[i];
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
```

### 1630. Arithmetic Subarrays
<em>
A sequence of numbers is called arithmetic if it consists of at least two elements, and the difference between every two consecutive elements is the same. More formally, a sequence s is arithmetic if and only if s[i+1] - s[i] == s[1] - s[0] for all valid i.

For example, these are arithmetic sequences:

1, 3, 5, 7, 9
7, 7, 7, 7
3, -1, -5, -9
The following sequence is not arithmetic:

1, 1, 2, 5, 7
You are given an array of n integers, nums, and two arrays of m integers each, l and r, representing the m range queries, where the ith query is the range [l[i], r[i]]. All the arrays are 0-indexed.

Return a list of boolean elements answer, where answer[i] is true if the subarray nums[l[i]], nums[l[i]+1], ... , nums[r[i]] can be rearranged to form an arithmetic sequence, and false otherwise.
</em>

brutal force
```cpp
    vector<bool> checkArithmeticSubarrays(vector<int>& nums, vector<int>& l, vector<int>& r) {
        vector<bool> ans;
        for(int i=0;i<l.size();i++){
            multiset<int> ms(begin(nums)+l[i],begin(nums)+r[i]+1);
            auto it=ms.begin(),it1=++ms.begin();
            int d=*it1-*it;
            bool valid=1;
            while(it1!=ms.end()){
                if(*it1++-*it++!=d) {valid=0;break;}
            }
            ans.push_back(valid);
        }
        return ans;
    }
```

### 1631. Path With Minimum Effort

<em>
You are a hiker preparing for an upcoming hike. You are given heights, a 2D array of size rows x columns, where heights[row][col] represents the height of cell (row, col). You are situated in the top-left cell, (0, 0), and you hope to travel to the bottom-right cell, (rows-1, columns-1) (i.e., 0-indexed). You can move up, down, left, or right, and you wish to find a route that requires the minimum effort.

A route's effort is the maximum absolute difference in heights between two consecutive cells of the route.

Return the minimum effort required to travel from the top-left cell to the bottom-right cell.
</em>

binary search + bfs/dfs

O(MN*logMx)

```cpp
    int minimumEffortPath(vector<vector<int>>& heights) {
        //binary search
        int l=0,r=1e6;
        while(l<r){
            int m=l+(r-l)/2;
            if(valid(heights,m)) r=m;
            else l=m+1;
        }
        return l;
    }
    bool valid(vector<vector<int>>& h,int diff){ //check if we can find a route with difference<=d
        int m=h.size(),n=h[0].size();
        queue<int> q;
        vector<bool> v(m*n);
        q.push(0);
        v[0]=1;
        int dir[][2]={{-1,0},{1,0},{0,-1},{0,1}};
        while(q.size()){
            int sz=q.size();
            while(sz--){
                int t=q.front();
                q.pop();
                int x=t/n,y=t%n;
                if(x==m-1 && y==n-1) return 1;
                for(auto d: dir){
                    int x0=x+d[0],y0=y+d[1];
                    if(x0<0 || y0<0 || x0>=m||y0>=n||v[x0*n+y0] || abs(h[x0][y0]-h[x][y])>diff) continue;
                    v[x0*n+y0]=1;
                    q.push(x0*n+y0);
                }
            }
        }
        return 0;
    }
```

other approach: using dijkstra O(MNlog(MN))
greedy: choose the min effort path first. using dp to record all i,j minimum.

```cpp
    int minimumEffortPath(vector<vector<int>>& heights) {
        int m=heights.size(),n=heights[0].size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(m,vector<int>(n,INT_MAX));
        priority_queue<vector<int>,vector<vector<int>>,greater<vector<int>>> pq;
        pq.push({0,0,0});//effort, coordinate
        int dir[][2]={{-1,0},{1,0},{0,-1},{0,1}};
        vector<bool> v(m*n);
        v[0]=1;
        while(pq.size()){
            auto vt=pq.top();
            pq.pop();
            int eff=vt[0],x=vt[1],y=vt[2];
            if(x==m-1 && y==n-1) return eff;
            v[x*n+y]=1;
            if(eff>=dp[x][y]) continue; //prune, discard this path
            dp[x][y]=min(dp[x][y],eff);
            for(auto d: dir){
                int x0=x+d[0],y0=y+d[1];
                if(x0<0||y0<0||x0>=m||y0>=n||v[x0*n+y0]) continue;
                int tmp=max(eff,abs(heights[x0][y0]-heights[x][y]));
                pq.push({tmp,x0,y0});
            }
        }
        return dp[m-1][n-1];
    }
```	
dijkstra + visited is slow.
binary search + bfs is faster. 
binary search + dfs fastest. (less memory and faster). the worst case will try all paths.
binary search + union find (check if two nodes are connected).


### 1632. Rank Transform of a Matrix
<em>
Given an m x n matrix, return a new matrix answer where answer[row][col] is the rank of matrix[row][col].

The rank is an integer that represents how large an element is compared to other elements. It is calculated using the following rules:

If an element is the smallest element in its row and column, then its rank is 1.
If two elements p and q are in the same row or column, then:
If p < q then rank(p) < rank(q)
If p == q then rank(p) == rank(q)
If p > q then rank(p) > rank(q)
The rank should be as small as possible.
It is guaranteed that answer is unique under the given rules.
</em>

- greedy: process in sorted order.
- using map to store element vs positions
- using union find to group the same value elements into groups and process each group separately
- each group same value elements are assigned the group max +1


```cpp
    struct union_find{
        vector<int> &rmin,&cmin;
        vector<vector<int>>& v;
        unordered_map<int,int> parent; //node vs parent and max
        unordered_map<int,int> mx; //parent vs max
        union_find(vector<int>& r,vector<int>& c,vector<vector<int>>& vv):rmin(r),cmin(c),v(vv){}
        void merge(){
            for(auto t: v){
                int pi=findp(t[0]),pj=findp(~t[1]);
                if(pi!=pj){
                    parent[pi]=pj;
                    mx[pj]=max({mx[pj],rmin[t[0]],cmin[t[1]]});
                    rmin[t[0]]=cmin[t[1]]=mx[pj];
                }
            }
        }
        int findp(int i){
            if(parent.count(i)==0) parent[i]=i;
            else{
                while(i!=parent[i]){
                    parent[i]=parent[parent[i]];
                    i=parent[i];
                }
            }
            return i;
        }
        int getmx(int i) {return mx[findp(i)];}
    };
    vector<vector<int>> matrixRankTransform(vector<vector<int>>& matrix) {
        int m=matrix.size(),n=matrix[0].size();
        vector<vector<int>> ans(m,vector<int>(n));
        map<int,vector<vector<int>>> mp;
        vector<int> rmin(m),cmin(n);
        for(int i=0;i<m;i++){
            for(int j=0;j<n;j++) mp[matrix[i][j]].push_back({i,j});
        }
        
        for(auto p: mp){
            union_find uf(rmin,cmin,p.second);
            uf.merge();
            for(auto t: p.second)
                rmin[t[0]]=cmin[t[1]]=ans[t[0]][t[1]]=uf.getmx(t[0])+1;
            
        }
        return ans;
