### 1108. Defanging an IP Address (*)
simple

### 1109. Corporate Flight Bookings  (***)
<em>Problem:

There are n flights, and they are labeled from 1 to n.

We have a list of flight bookings.  The i-th booking bookings[i] = [i, j, k] means that we booked k seats from flights labeled i to j inclusive.

Return an array answer of length n, representing the number of seats booked on each flight in order of their label.

 

Example 1:

Input: bookings = [[1,2,10],[2,3,20],[2,5,25]], n = 5
Output: [10,55,45,25,25]
</em>

The description is very unclear. Actually ii,j,k means from flight i to j, there are k seats booking. (i,j) is a flight range not an edge defining a flight).
so actually it is defining a list of intervals and get each number.
typical interval problem

```cpp
    vector<int> corpFlightBookings(vector<vector<int>>& bookings, int n) {
        vector<int> ans(n);
        map<int,int> book;
        for(auto t: bookings){
            book[t[0]]+=t[2]; //add
            book[t[1]+1]-=t[2]; //remove
        }
        int prefix=0;
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            if(book.count(i+1)) {
                prefix+=book[i+1];
            }
            ans[i]=prefix;
        }
        return ans;
    }
```	

### 1110. Delete Nodes And Return Forest (***)
atually post-order is better.

```cpp
    vector<TreeNode*> delNodes(TreeNode* root, vector<int>& to_delete) {
        vector<TreeNode*> ans;
        unordered_set<int> del(to_delete.begin(),to_delete.end());
        if(delNodes(root,del,ans)) ans.push_back(root);
        return ans;
    }
    TreeNode* delNodes(TreeNode* root,unordered_set<int>& del,vector<TreeNode*>& ans){
        if(!root) return 0;
        if(del.empty()) return root;
        //preorder
        if(del.count(root->val)){
            del.erase(root->val);//root is deleted
            TreeNode* left=delNodes(root->left,del,ans);
            TreeNode* right=delNodes(root->right,del,ans);
            if(left) ans.push_back(left);
            if(right) ans.push_back(right);
            return 0;
        }

        //its left and right will be modified.
        root->left=delNodes(root->left,del,ans);
        root->right=delNodes(root->right,del,ans);
        return root;
    }
```
### 1111. Maximum Nesting Depth of Two Valid Parentheses Strings	(***)
<em>
A string is a valid parentheses string (denoted VPS) if and only if it consists of "(" and ")" characters only, and:

It is the empty string, or
It can be written as AB (A concatenated with B), where A and B are VPS's, or
It can be written as (A), where A is a VPS.
We can similarly define the nesting depth depth(S) of any VPS S as follows:

depth("") = 0
depth(A + B) = max(depth(A), depth(B)), where A and B are VPS's
depth("(" + A + ")") = 1 + depth(A), where A is a VPS.
For example,  "", "()()", and "()(()())" are VPS's (with nesting depths 0, 1, and 2), and ")(" and "(()" are not VPS's.

 

Given a VPS seq, split it into two disjoint subsequences A and B, such that A and B are VPS's (and A.length + B.length = seq.length).

Now choose any such A and B such that max(depth(A), depth(B)) is the minimum possible value.

Return an answer array (of length seq.length) that encodes such a choice of A and B:  answer[i] = 0 if seq[i] is part of A, else answer[i] = 1.  Note that even though multiple answers may exist, you may return any of them.

 

Example 1:

Input: seq = "(()())"
Output: [0,1,1,1,1,0]
Example 2:

Input: seq = "()(())()"
Output: [0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1]
</em>


Idea: 
if the total depth is n, then break into A and B with n/2 and n-n/2, the difference will be minimized.
so we shall choose depth alternatively.
for parenthesis, we can use ++-- or stack.
- calculate the depth and assign even depth to 0 and odd depth to 1.
example:
((()))
123321
010010
```cpp
    vector<int> maxDepthAfterSplit(string seq) {
        vector<int> ans(seq.size()); //all assigned as 0
		int sum=0;
		for(int i=0;i<seq.size();i++){
			if(seq[i]=='(') {
				sum++;
				if(sum%2) ans[i]=1;
			}
			else{
				if(sum%2) ans[i]=1;
				sum--;
			}
		}
		return ans;
    }
