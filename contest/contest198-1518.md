### 1518. Water Bottles
<em>
Given numBottles full water bottles, you can exchange numExchange empty water bottles for one full water bottle.

The operation of drinking a full water bottle turns it into an empty bottle.

Return the maximum number of water bottles you can drink.
</em>

simple, just simulate the process

```cpp
    int numWaterBottles(int numBottles, int numExchange) {
        int ans=0,empty=0;
        while(numBottles){
            ans+=numBottles;
            empty+=numBottles;//%numExchange;
            numBottles=empty/numExchange;
            empty%=numExchange;
            //cout<<numBottles<<endl;
        }
        return ans;
    }
```

### 1519. Number of Nodes in the Sub-Tree With the Same Label
<em>
Given a tree (i.e. a connected, undirected graph that has no cycles) consisting of n nodes numbered from 0 to n - 1 and exactly n - 1 edges. The root of the tree is the node 0, and each node of the tree has a label which is a lower-case character given in the string labels (i.e. The node with the number i has the label labels[i]).

The edges array is given on the form edges[i] = [ai, bi], which means there is an edge between nodes ai and bi in the tree.

Return an array of size n where ans[i] is the number of nodes in the subtree of the ith node which have the same label as node i.

A subtree of a tree T is the tree consisting of a node in T and all of its descendant nodes.
</em>

idea:
- build adjacency matrix.
- postorder traversal.	
- using hashmap to store its subtree char's occurrence.

```cpp
    vector<int> countSubTrees(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges, string labels) {
        vector<vector<int>> adj(n);
        for(auto e: edges){
            adj[e[0]].push_back(e[1]);
            adj[e[1]].push_back(e[0]);
        }
        vector<int> ans(n),v(n);
        postorder(adj,labels,0,-1,v,ans);
        return ans;
    }
    vector<int> postorder(vector<vector<int>>& adj,string& labels,int root,int p,vector<int>& v,vector<int>& ans){
        vector<int> cnt(26);
        for(int child: adj[root]){
            if(v[child] || child==p) continue;
            v[child]=1;
            auto t=postorder(adj,labels,child,root,v,ans);
            for(int i=0;i<26;i++) cnt[i]+=t[i];
        }
        //cout<<root<<endl;
        cnt[labels[root]-'a']++;
        ans[root]=cnt[labels[root]-'a'];
        return cnt;
    }
```

### 1520. Maximum Number of Non-Overlapping Substrings
<em>
Given a string s of lowercase letters, you need to find the maximum number of non-empty substrings of s that meet the following conditions:

The substrings do not overlap, that is for any two substrings s[i..j] and s[k..l], either j < k or i > l is true.
A substring that contains a certain character c must also contain all occurrences of c.
Find the maximum number of substrings that meet the above conditions. If there are multiple solutions with the same number of substrings, return the one with minimum total length. It can be shown that there exists a unique solution of minimum total length.

Notice that you can return the substrings in any order.
</em>

idea:
- get the first and last index for each char.
- using the char in the range, we need to extend the segment.
- then after each char's segment is settled, we need to find the longest non-overlapping segments, which is a greedy approach
sort using end, and always using smaller end segment first.

extending the segment could cause a lot of incorrect answers.
one idea is: we loop using the dynamically changed ending, when the left side does not change, then we reach the final segment.
```cpp
    vector<string> maxNumOfSubstrings(string s) {
        int n = s.length();
        vector<int> vals(n);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            vals[i] = s[i] - 'a';
        }
        
        vector<int> fst(26, 1e9);
        vector<int> lst(26, -1);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            fst[vals[i]] = min(fst[vals[i]], i);
            lst[vals[i]] = max(lst[vals[i]], i);
        }
        
        vector<pair<int, int>> t;
        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
            int start = fst[i];
            int end = lst[i];
            for (int j = start; j <= end; j++) {
                start = min(start, fst[vals[j]]);
                end = max(end, lst[vals[j]]);
            }
            if (start < n && start == fst[i]) {
                t.emplace_back(end, start);
            }
        }
        
        sort(t.begin(), t.end());
        vector<string> ans;
        int prev = -1;
        for (auto &[end, start] : t) {
            if (start > prev) {
                ans.push_back(s.substr(start, 1 + end - start));
                prev = end;
            }
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
```

### 1521. Find a Value of a Mysterious Function Closest to Target
the minimum of |func(A,l,r)-target|.
func(A,l,r) is the bit and of element in [l,r].

idea:
- and will not increase, only decrease or not change.
- using hash set to record previous and current and results
- the elements in hash set will not exceed 32.

```cpp
    int closestToTarget(vector<int>& arr, int target) {
        unordered_set<int> ms;
        int ans=INT_MAX;
        for(int i: arr){
            unordered_set<int> ms1;
            for(auto t: ms) ms1.insert(t&i);
            ms1.insert(i);
            for(auto t: ms1) ans=min(ans,abs(t-target));
            ms=ms1;
        }
        return ans;
    }
```
so the complexity would be O(32N)
