1700. Number of Students Unable to Eat Lunch

<em>
The school cafeteria offers circular and square sandwiches at lunch break, referred to by numbers 0 and 1 respectively. All students stand in a queue. Each student either prefers square or circular sandwiches.

The number of sandwiches in the cafeteria is equal to the number of students. The sandwiches are placed in a stack. At each step:

If the student at the front of the queue prefers the sandwich on the top of the stack, they will take it and leave the queue.
Otherwise, they will leave it and go to the queue's end.
This continues until none of the queue students want to take the top sandwich and are thus unable to eat.

You are given two integer arrays students and sandwiches where sandwiches[i] is the type of the i​​​​​​th sandwich in the stack (i = 0 is the top of the stack) and students[j] is the preference of the j​​​​​​th student in the initial queue (j = 0 is the front of the queue). Return the number of students that are unable to eat.
</em>

simulate the process.

```cpp
    int countStudents(vector<int>& students, vector<int>& sandwiches) {
        deque<int> dq;//(rbegin(students),rend(students));
        for(int i: students) dq.push_back(i);
        int i=0,ans=0,n=students.size(),cnt=0;
        while(dq.size() && i<n){
            if(sandwiches[i]==dq.front()) ans++,i++,cnt=0,dq.pop_front();
            else {
                dq.push_back(dq.front()),dq.pop_front();
                cnt++;
                if(cnt==dq.size()) break;
            }
        }
        return n-ans;
    }
```

1701. Average Waiting Time
<em>
There is a restaurant with a single chef. You are given an array customers, where customers[i] = [arrivali, timei]:

arrivali is the arrival time of the ith customer. The arrival times are sorted in non-decreasing order.
timei is the time needed to prepare the order of the ith customer.
When a customer arrives, he gives the chef his order, and the chef starts preparing it once he is idle. The customer waits till the chef finishes preparing his order. The chef does not prepare food for more than one customer at a time. The chef prepares food for customers in the order they were given in the input.

Return the average waiting time of all customers. Solutions within 10-5 from the actual answer are considered accepted.
</em>

```cpp
    double averageWaitingTime(vector<vector<int>>& customers) {
        int n=customers.size();
        double total_time=0;
        int start=customers[0][0],end=customers[0][1]+start;
        total_time+=end-start;
        for(int i=1;i<n;i++){
            start=max(end,customers[i][0]); 
            end=start+customers[i][1];
            total_time+=end-customers[i][0];
        }
        return double(total_time)/n;
    }
```

1702. Maximum Binary String After Change
<em>
You are given a binary string binary consisting of only 0's or 1's. You can apply each of the following operations any number of times:

Operation 1: If the number contains the substring "00", you can replace it with "10".
For example, "00010" -> "10010"
Operation 2: If the number contains the substring "10", you can replace it with "01".
For example, "00010" -> "00001"
Return the maximum binary string you can obtain after any number of operations. Binary string x is greater than binary string y if x's decimal representation is greater than y's decimal representation.

</em>

greedy: if there are two 0, we can always shift 2nd zero to left and then shift the first 0 right one step and eliminate the 2nd zero.

```cpp
    string maximumBinaryString(string binary) {
        int n=binary.size();
        //find the first 0 and if we have 0 on its right, all previous becomes 1
        //until we only have one 0 left.
        int left=-1;
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            if(binary[i]=='0'){
                if(left<0) left=i;
                else{
                    binary[left]='1';binary[left+1]='0';left++;
                    if(i!=left) binary[i]='1';
                }
                //cout<<binary<<endl;
            }
        }
        return binary;
    }
```

1703. Minimum Adjacent Swaps for K Consecutive Ones
<em>
You are given an integer array, nums, and an integer k. nums comprises of only 0's and 1's. In one move, you can choose two adjacent indices and swap their values.

Return the minimum number of moves required so that nums has k consecutive 1's.
</em>

idea: find the min window containing k 1s. (prefix sum + hashmap)
then find the min moves: move to the median (see best meeting place).

```cpp
    int minMoves(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        vector<long> A, B(1);
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i)
            if (nums[i])
                A.push_back(i);
        long n = A.size(), res = 2e9;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            B.push_back(B[i] + A[i]);
        for (int i = 0; i < n - k + 1; ++i)
            res = min(res, B[i + k] - B[k / 2 + i] - B[(k + 1) / 2 + i] + B[i]);
        res -= (k / 2) * ((k + 1) / 2);
        return res;
    }
```
