1800. Maximum Ascending Subarray Sum
<em>
Given an array of positive integers nums, return the maximum possible sum of an ascending subarray in nums.

A subarray is defined as a contiguous sequence of numbers in an array.

A subarray [numsl, numsl+1, ..., numsr-1, numsr] is ascending if for all i where l <= i < r, numsi < numsi+1. Note that a subarray of size 1 is ascending.
</em>

similar to max subarray sum, connect or not.
```
    int maxAscendingSum(vector<int>& nums) {
        int ans=0;
        //vector<int> pre(1);
        //for(int i: nums) pre.push_back(pre.back()+i);
        int sum=0;
        for(int i=0;i<nums.size();i++){
            if(i==0 || nums[i]>nums[i-1]) sum+=nums[i];
            else sum=nums[i];
            ans=max(ans,sum);
        }
        return ans;
    }

1801. Number of Orders in the Backlog
<em>

You are given a 2D integer array orders, where each orders[i] = [pricei, amounti, orderTypei] denotes that amounti orders have been placed of type orderTypei at the price pricei. The orderTypei is:

0 if it is a batch of buy orders, or
1 if it is a batch of sell orders.
Note that orders[i] represents a batch of amounti independent orders with the same price and order type. All orders represented by orders[i] will be placed before all orders represented by orders[i+1] for all valid i.

There is a backlog that consists of orders that have not been executed. The backlog is initially empty. When an order is placed, the following happens:

If the order is a buy order, you look at the sell order with the smallest price in the backlog. If that sell order's price is smaller than or equal to the current buy order's price, they will match and be executed, and that sell order will be removed from the backlog. Else, the buy order is added to the backlog.
Vice versa, if the order is a sell order, you look at the buy order with the largest price in the backlog. If that buy order's price is larger than or equal to the current sell order's price, they will match and be executed, and that buy order will be removed from the backlog. Else, the sell order is added to the backlog.
Return the total amount of orders in the backlog after placing all the orders from the input. Since this number can be large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

 using one maxheap for buy and min heap for sell
 ```
     int getNumberOfBacklogOrders(vector<vector<int>>& orders) {
        int mod=1e9+7;
        //pq: 
        long ans=0;
        priority_queue<vector<int>> buy;//max heap
        priority_queue<vector<int>,vector<vector<int>>,greater<vector<int>>> sell; //min heap
       
        for(auto p: orders){
            ans+=p[1];
            if(p[2]==0){ //buy order
                while(sell.size() && p[0]>=sell.top()[0] && p[1]){
                    auto tp=sell.top();
                    sell.pop();
                    ans-=2*min(tp[1],p[1]);
                    if(p[1]>=tp[1]) {
                        p[1]-=tp[1];
                    }
                    else {
                        sell.push({tp[0],tp[1]-p[1]});
                        p[1]=0;
                        break;
                    }
                }
                if(p[1]>0) buy.push({p[0],p[1]});
            }
            else{ //sell order
                while(buy.size() && p[0]<=buy.top()[0] && p[1]){
                    auto tp=buy.top();
                    buy.pop();
                    ans-=2*min(tp[1],p[1]);
                    if(p[1]>=tp[1]) {
                        p[1]-=tp[1];
                    }
                    else {
                        buy.push({tp[0],tp[1]-p[1]});
                        p[1]=0;
                        break;
                    }
                }
                if(p[1]>0) sell.push({p[0],p[1]});
            }
        }
        return ans%mod;
    }

1802. Maximum Value at a Given Index in a Bounded Array
<em>
You are given three positive integers n, index and maxSum. You want to construct an array nums (0-indexed) that satisfies the following conditions:

nums.length == n
nums[i] is a positive integer where 0 <= i < n.
abs(nums[i] - nums[i+1]) <= 1 where 0 <= i < n-1.
The sum of all the elements of nums does not exceed maxSum.
nums[index] is maximized.
Return nums[index] of the constructed array.

Note that abs(x) equals x if x >= 0, and -x otherwise.
</em>

binary search among 1 and maxSum.
The tricky part is to calculate the sum with the peak value=mid at index=ind.

```
    int maxValue(int n, int index, int maxSum) {
        //binary search?
        int l=1,r=maxSum;
        while(l<r){
            int m=l+(r-l+1)/2; //right
            if(valid(m,n,index,maxSum)) l=m;
            else r=m-1;
        }
        return l;
    }
    bool valid(int mid,int n,int ind,int mxSum){
        //a[ind]=mid and also satisfy the condition
        long l=calcSum(0,ind,mid),r=calcSum(0,n-1-ind,mid);
        long sum=mid+l+r;//min sum
        if(mxSum<sum) return 0;
        return 1;
    }
	long calcSum(int l,int r,int rval){ //right index=rval, and left decreased by 1
        if(l>=r) return 0;
		if(rval<r+1) return r+1-rval+(long)rval*(rval-1)/2; //1 to mid-1 
		return (long)r*(rval-r+rval-1)/2;//rval: r, x: 0
	}
```	

pretty tricky
- to calculate the sum involves some math for the sum. (need to be extra careful)
- binary search to go right.
O(logn)
actually it is very simple if we iterate to get the sum. O(nlogn).

1803. Count Pairs With XOR in a Range
<em>
Given a (0-indexed) integer array nums and two integers low and high, return the number of nice pairs.

A nice pair is a pair (i, j) where 0 <= i < j < nums.length and low <= (nums[i] XOR nums[j]) <= high.
</em>

binary Trie with some tricks. not that straightforward.
critical: get the count with xor <limit.
- add a cnt field to count number of elements having this bit.
- get the number of pairs with xor < limit which is very tricky to reduce complexity.
1. for each number, count the number xor <limit (this is similar to two loops)
2. if limit bit is 1, the subtree with xor=0 would be <limit. So we add this to choose the opposite branch to go down.
3. if limit bit is 0, xor shall be 0 and goes down.

```
    const int HEIGHT = 14;
    
    class TreeNode {
    public:
        TreeNode* next[2];
        int cnt;
        TreeNode () {
            next[0] = nullptr;
            next[1] = nullptr;
            cnt = 0;
        };
    };
    
    void insert(TreeNode* root, int num) {
        TreeNode* cur = root;
        for (int j = HEIGHT; j >= 0; j--) {
            int index = ((num >> j) & 1);
            if (cur->next[index] == nullptr)
                cur->next[index] = new TreeNode();
            cur = cur->next[index];
            cur->cnt++;
        }
    }
    
    int GetCount(TreeNode* root, int num, int limit) {
        TreeNode* cur = root;
        int cnt = 0;
        for (int j = HEIGHT; j >= 0; j--) {
            int bit_num = ((num >> j) & 1);
            int bit_limit = ((limit >> j) & 1);
            
            if (bit_limit == 1) {
                // For bit_num branch, its values are all < limit
                if (cur->next[bit_num] != nullptr) {
                    cnt += cur->next[bit_num]->cnt;
                }
                // we try to pick the side so that it XOR bit_num is 1.
                cur = cur->next[1 - bit_num];
            } else {
                // we pick 'bit_num' child so that it does not exceed limit.
                cur = cur->next[bit_num];
            }
            
            if (cur == nullptr) break;
        }
        return cnt;
    }
    
public:
    int countPairs(vector<int>& nums, int low, int high) {
        TreeNode* root = new TreeNode();
        
        int ans = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            ans += GetCount(root, num, high + 1) - GetCount(root, num, low);
            insert(root, num);
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
```
