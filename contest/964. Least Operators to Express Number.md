### Problem Summary
Given a x, and use +-*/ to reach a target, with not using ().
Get the least number of operators

### approach
I have not get any solution on this. 
- / is rational divide and we can only get x/x
- any * is used to get x^n (using n *) and x/x can be considered x^0
- + is to combine the result for all the x^n
- - is a bit harder. 

A number can be composed sum(x^i) with 0 or 1 as the coefficient, which is the binary representation of an integer. 
for x-ary base, the coefficient could be from 0 to x-1.

It's obvious that the expression should be
C0*x^0 + C1*x^1 + ... + Cn*x^n
And there is only one way to get x^0 by x / x, and it's the only use for divide operation.
Then regard target as a x base number(for example, the 3 base form of 19 is 201)

So:
Consider about generating parts[i]*x^i, you can get it by two ways (you will never generate parts[i] * x^i by some expression other than x^i):
x^i + x^i + ... + x^i (parts[i] times)
x^(i+1) - x^i - x^i - ... - x^i (x - parts[i] times).

Thinking the problem using x-base problem is the key!

As a concrete example, say x = 5, target = 123. We either add 2 or subtract 3. This leaves us with a target of 120 or 125. If the target is 120, we can either add 5 or subtract 20, leaving us with a target of 100 or 125. If the target is 100, we can either add 25 or subtract 100, leaving us with a target of 125 or 0. If the target is 125, we subtract 125.

dp approach: dp[i, target]: i is the exponential, target is the target to solve.
