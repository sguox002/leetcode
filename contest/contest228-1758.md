1758. Minimum Changes To Make Alternating Binary String
<em>
You are given a string s consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'. In one operation, you can change any '0' to '1' or vice versa.

The string is called alternating if no two adjacent characters are equal. For example, the string "010" is alternating, while the string "0100" is not.

Return the minimum number of operations needed to make s alternating.
</em>

simple:
```
    int minOperations(string s) {
        int cnt=0,n=s.size();
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            if(i%2) cnt+=s[i]=='0';
            else cnt+=s[i]=='1';
        }
        return min(cnt,n-cnt);
    }
```

1759. Count Number of Homogenous Substrings
<em>
Given a string s, return the number of homogenous substrings of s. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

A string is homogenous if all the characters of the string are the same.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.
</em>

add an extra char at the end to avoid last round missing.

```
    int countHomogenous(string s) {
        int pre=0,cnt=0;
        s+='$';
        long ans=0;
        int mod=1e9+7;
        for(char c: s){
            if(c!=pre){
                ans+=(long)cnt*(cnt+1)/2;
                ans%=mod;
                pre=c;
                cnt=1;
            }
            else cnt++;
        }
        return ans;
    }
```

1760. Minimum Limit of Balls in a Bag
<em>
You are given an integer array nums where the ith bag contains nums[i] balls. You are also given an integer maxOperations.

You can perform the following operation at most maxOperations times:

Take any bag of balls and divide it into two new bags with a positive number of balls.
For example, a bag of 5 balls can become two new bags of 1 and 4 balls, or two new bags of 2 and 3 balls.
Your penalty is the maximum number of balls in a bag. You want to minimize your penalty after the operations.

Return the minimum possible penalty after performing the operations.
</em>

binary search:

```
    int minimumSize(vector<int>& nums, int maxOp) {
        int n=nums.size();
        //binary search
        int l=1,r=INT_MAX;
        while(l<r){
            int m=l+(r-l)/2; //max is m
            if(valid(nums,m,maxOp)) r=m; //can achieve max
            else l=m+1;    
        }
        return l;
    }
    bool valid(vector<int>& nums,int mn,int maxop){
        int ans=0;
        for(int i: nums){
            if(i>mn) ans+=i%mn?i/mn:i/mn-1; //need split
        }
        return ans<=maxop;
    }
```

1761. Minimum Degree of a Connected Trio in a Graph
<em>
You are given an undirected graph. You are given an integer n which is the number of nodes in the graph and an array edges, where each edges[i] = [ui, vi] indicates that there is an undirected edge between ui and vi.

A connected trio is a set of three nodes where there is an edge between every pair of them.

The degree of a connected trio is the number of edges where one endpoint is in the trio, and the other is not.

Return the minimum degree of a connected trio in the graph, or -1 if the graph has no connected trios.
</em>

using adjacent list will TLE
using adjacency matrix will be much faster.

```
    int adj[401][401]={},cnt[401];
    
    int minTrioDegree(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        memset(adj,0,sizeof(adj));
        memset(cnt,0,sizeof(cnt));
        for(auto e: edges){
            adj[e[0]][e[1]]=adj[e[1]][e[0]]=1;
            cnt[e[0]]++,cnt[e[1]]++;
        }
        int ans=INT_MAX;
        for(int i=1;i<=n;i++){
            for(int j=i+1;j<=n;j++){
                if(!adj[i][j]) continue;
                for(int k=j+1;k<=n;k++){
                    if(!adj[i][k] || !adj[j][k]) continue;
                    ans=min(ans,cnt[i]+cnt[j]+cnt[k]-6);
                }
            }
        }
        return ans==INT_MAX?-1:ans;
    }
```
