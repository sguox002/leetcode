### 1217. Play with Chips (***)
_Problem: 

There are some chips, and the i-th chip is at position chips[i].

You can perform any of the two following types of moves any number of times (possibly zero) on any chip:

Move the i-th chip by 2 units to the left or to the right with a cost of 0.
Move the i-th chip by 1 unit to the left or to the right with a cost of 1.
There can be two or more chips at the same position initially.

Return the minimum cost needed to move all the chips to the same position (any position)._

Approach:

[1,2,3]: chip 0 at pos 1, chip 1 at pos 2, chip 2 at pos 3</br>
[2,2,2,3,3]: chip 0 at pos 2, chip 1 at pos 2, chip 2 at pos 2, chip 3 at pos 3, chip 4 at pos 3</br>
odd position add 1 becomes even, all odd can go to one position at no cost. all even position can go to even positon at no cost
but move each type of chip from odd to even or from even to odd cost 1. n types cost n.</br>
understand the problem is critical</br>

```cpp
    int minCostToMoveChips(vector<int>& chips) {
        int odd=0,even=0;
        for(int i: chips) {
            if(i%2) odd++;
            else even++;
        }
        //odd
        return min(odd,even);
    }
```

### 1218. Longest Arithmetic Subsequence of Given Difference (***)
*Problem: Given an integer array arr and an integer difference, return the length of the longest subsequence in arr which is an arithmetic sequence such that the difference between adjacent elements in the subsequence equals difference.*

idea: dp with hashmap. note: you cannot sort or alter the array.
```cpp
    int longestSubsequence(vector<int>& arr, int difference) 
    {
        unordered_map<int,int> lengths;
        int result=1;
        for(int &i:arr)
            result=max(result,lengths[i]=1+lengths[i-difference]); 
	    //Length of AP ending with 'i' with difference of 'difference' will be 1 + length of AP ending with 'i-difference'. result stores Max at each end
        return result;
    }
```
	
### 1219. Path with Maximum Gold (***)
*Problem: In a gold mine grid of size m * n, each cell in this mine has an integer representing the amount of gold in that cell, 0 if it is empty.

Return the maximum amount of gold you can collect under the conditions:

Every time you are located in a cell you will collect all the gold in that cell.
- From your position you can walk one step to the left, right, up or down.
- You can't visit the same cell more than once.
- Never visit a cell with 0 gold.
- You can start and stop collecting gold from any position in the grid that has some gold.*

idea:
so 0 is actually obstacle you cannot go. and you cannot visit the cell again
[[0,6,0],
 [5,8,7],
 [0,9,0]]
 9-8-7 and stop.
 brutal force: start at any position and try dfs and get the max. Once a cell is visited, change it to 0 immediately. restore back after the dfs is done for next dfs with different start point.
 ```cpp
     int getMaximumGold(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int m=grid.size(),n=grid[0].size();
        int ans=0;
        for(int i=0;i<m;i++){
            for(int j=0;j<n;j++){
                if(grid[i][j]) dfs(grid,i,j,0,ans);
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
    void dfs(vector<vector<int>>& g,int i,int j,int tsum,int& maxsum){
        if(i<0||j<0||i>=g.size()||j>=g[0].size()||!g[i][j]) return;
        int t=g[i][j];
        maxsum=max(maxsum,tsum+t);
        g[i][j]=0;
        dfs(g,i-1,j,tsum+t,maxsum);
        dfs(g,i+1,j,tsum+t,maxsum);
        dfs(g,i,j-1,tsum+t,maxsum);
        dfs(g,i,j+1,tsum+t,maxsum);
        g[i][j]=t;
    }
```
	

### 1220. Count Vowels Permutation (****)
Given an integer n, your task is to count how many strings of length n can be formed under the following rules:

Each character is a lower case vowel ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u')
Each vowel 'a' may only be followed by an 'e'.
Each vowel 'e' may only be followed by an 'a' or an 'i'.
Each vowel 'i' may not be followed by another 'i'.
Each vowel 'o' may only be followed by an 'i' or a 'u'.
Each vowel 'u' may only be followed by an 'a'.
Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

this is similar to the phone number problem.
a->e.
e->a,i.
i->aeou
o->iu
u->a.

dp problem: dp is easier if we think it reverse, not follow but previous.
```cpp
    int countVowelPermutation(int n) {
        int mod=1e9+7;
        //dp: dp[c][i] represents the number of permutations ending with c, length i
        vector<long> cur(5,1),prev(5);
        //reversed thinking: see previous char (incoming edges)
        //a: e, i, u
        //e: a,i
        //i: e,o
        //o: i
        //u: i,o
        for(int i=1;i<n;i++){
            prev=cur;
            cur[0]=(prev[1]+prev[2]+prev[4])%mod;
            cur[1]=(prev[0]+prev[2])%mod;
            cur[2]=(prev[1]+prev[3])%mod;
            cur[3]=prev[2];
            cur[4]=(prev[2]+prev[3])%mod;
        }
        int t=0;
        for(int i=0;i<5;i++) t+=cur[i],t%=mod;
        return t;
    }
```
