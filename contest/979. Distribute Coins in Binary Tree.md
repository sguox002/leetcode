### Problem Summary
A tree with N nodes and N total coins, the objective is to distribute the coins to 1 at each node
each step you can pass a coin to parent or its direct child.

### Approach
For a node we shall calculate its left subtree and right subtree balance. (sum of coins - number of nodes)
the balance could be negative or positive. If negative, we shall pass in the balance from the root. If positive we need pass out balance to its parent, i.e the abs(coins)
each coin from root or to root need one step.
So, we can use postorder traversal to get the balance and add up the absolute values.

### code
```cpp
    int distributeCoins(TreeNode* root) {
        int steps=0;
        postorder(root,steps);
        return steps;
    }
    int postorder(TreeNode* root,int& steps)
    {
        if(!root) return 0;
        int coins=postorder(root->left,steps)+postorder(root->right,steps);
        coins+=root->val-1;
        steps+=abs(coins);//coins need to past to parent
        return coins;
    }
```

### comments
- get the balance of the subtree need not two dfs, but one is fine, to minus 1 from each node
- the steps, regardless the direction, count one step.
