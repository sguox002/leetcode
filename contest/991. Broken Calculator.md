### Problem Summary
On a broken calculator that has a number showing on its display, we can perform two operations:

Double: Multiply the number on the display by 2, or;
Decrement: Subtract 1 from the number on the display.
Initially, the calculator is displaying the number X.

Return the minimum number of operations needed to display the number Y.

### Analysis
This is a greedy choice.
If Y is odd, the last step is dec 1
If Y is even, the last step is x2
when y<x only dec is allowed

Decrease the problem Y to X, which is a typical greedy problem.

```cpp
    int brokenCalc(int X, int Y) {
        //every step we can choose -1 or *2
        //greedy solution: 
        //if Y is even, divide by 2, if Y is odd add 1
        int res = 0;
        while (Y > X) {
            Y = Y % 2 > 0 ? Y + 1 : Y / 2;
            res++;
        }
        return res + X - Y;        
    }
```
