### 1614. Maximum Nesting Depth of the Parentheses
<em>
A string is a valid parentheses string (denoted VPS) if it meets one of the following:

It is an empty string "", or a single character not equal to "(" or ")",
It can be written as AB (A concatenated with B), where A and B are VPS's, or
It can be written as (A), where A is a VPS.
We can similarly define the nesting depth depth(S) of any VPS S as follows:

depth("") = 0
depth(A + B) = max(depth(A), depth(B)), where A and B are VPS's
depth("(" + A + ")") = 1 + depth(A), where A is a VPS.
For example, "", "()()", and "()(()())" are VPS's (with nesting depths 0, 1, and 2), and ")(" and "(()" are not VPS's.

Given a VPS represented as string s, return the nesting depth of s.
</em>

( +1 and ) -1, we are looking for the max positives.

```cpp
    int maxDepth(string s) {
        int ans=0;
        int cnt=0;
        for(char c: s){
            if(c=='(') cnt++;
            else if(c==')') ans=max(ans,cnt--);
        }
        return ans;
    }
```

### 1615. Maximal Network Rank
<em>

There is an infrastructure of n cities with some number of roads connecting these cities. Each roads[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is a bidirectional road between cities ai and bi.

The network rank of two different cities is defined as the total number of directly connected roads to either city. If a road is directly connected to both cities, it is only counted once.

The maximal network rank of the infrastructure is the maximum network rank of all pairs of different cities.

Given the integer n and the array roads, return the maximal network rank of the entire infrastructure.
<em>

The statement is very confusing. Even the example I cannot figure out why.
It actually count: number of incoming for node i. The max of pair sum. The direct connection shall only count once.

so the approach: count each node's incoming and record direct connection and try all pairs

```cpp
    int maximalNetworkRank(int n, vector<vector<int>>& roads) {
        //correct understand this is critical
        //count incoming roads, direct connect count only once
        vector<int> cnt(n);
        unordered_set<int> adj;
        for(auto t: roads){
            if(t[0]>t[1]) swap(t[0],t[1]);
            cnt[t[0]]++;
            cnt[t[1]]++;
            adj.insert((t[0]<<16)+t[1]);
        }
        int ans=0;
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            for(int j=i+1;j<n;j++){
                ans=max(ans,cnt[i]+cnt[j]-(int)adj.count((i<<16)+j));
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
```

### 1616. Split Two Strings to Make Palindrome
<em>
You are given two strings a and b of the same length. Choose an index and split both strings at the same index, splitting a into two strings: aprefix and asuffix where a = aprefix + asuffix, and splitting b into two strings: bprefix and bsuffix where b = bprefix + bsuffix. Check if aprefix + bsuffix or bprefix + asuffix forms a palindrome.

When you split a string s into sprefix and ssuffix, either ssuffix or sprefix is allowed to be empty. For example, if s = "abc", then "" + "abc", "a" + "bc", "ab" + "c" , and "abc" + "" are valid splits.

Return true if it is possible to form a palindrome string, otherwise return false.

Notice that x + y denotes the concatenation of strings x and y.
</em>

approach:
- only several combinations
a choose empty, whole b is chosen
b choose empty, whole a is chosen
choose a prefix, choose b suffix (greedy one char is fine)
choose a suffix, choose a prefix (greedy one char is fine)

note: it needs the same index!!!!

```cpp
    bool isPa(string& s, int i, int j) {
        for (; i < j; ++i, --j)
            if (s[i] != s[j])
                return false;
        return true;
    }

    bool check(string& a, string& b) {
        for (int i = 0, j = a.size() - 1; i < j; ++i, --j)
            if (a[i] != b[j])
                return isPa(a, i, j) || isPa(b, i, j);
        return true;
    }

    bool checkPalindromeFormation(string a, string b) {
        return check(a, b) || check(b, a);
    }
```
note the submission is incorrect!

### 1617. Count Subtrees With Max Distance Between Cities
<em>
There are n cities numbered from 1 to n. You are given an array edges of size n-1, where edges[i] = [ui, vi] represents a bidirectional edge between cities ui and vi. There exists a unique path between each pair of cities. In other words, the cities form a tree.

A subtree is a subset of cities where every city is reachable from every other city in the subset, where the path between each pair passes through only the cities from the subset. Two subtrees are different if there is a city in one subtree that is not present in the other.

For each d from 1 to n-1, find the number of subtrees in which the maximum distance between any two cities in the subtree is equal to d.

Return an array of size n-1 where the dth element (1-indexed) is the number of subtrees in which the maximum distance between any two cities is equal to d.

Notice that the distance between the two cities is the number of edges in the path between them.
</em>

brutal force:
try all combinations using bitset
for each set, dfs to find the diameter of the tree. (it may be an invalid tree).

```cpp
    vector<int> countSubgraphsForEachDiameter(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        int INF = n; // Since cities form a tree so maximum distance between 2 cities always < n
        vector<vector<int>> dist(n, vector<int>(n, INF));
        for (auto& e : edges) 
            dist[e[0]-1][e[1]-1] = dist[e[1]-1][e[0]-1] = 1;
        
        for (int k = 0; k < n; k++)
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
                for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)
                    dist[i][j] = min(dist[i][j], dist[i][k] + dist[k][j]);
        
        vector<int> ans(n - 1, 0);
        for (int state = 0; state < (1 << n); state++) {
            int d = maxDistance(state, dist, n);
            if (d > 0) ans[d - 1] += 1;
        }
        return ans;
    }
    
    int maxDistance(int state, vector<vector<int>>& dist, int n) {
        int cntEdge = 0, cntCity = 0, maxDist = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (((state >> i) & 1) == 0) continue; // Skip if city `i` not in our subset
            cntCity += 1;
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
                if (((state >> j) & 1) == 0) continue; // Skip if city `j` not in our subset
                cntEdge += dist[i][j] == 1;
                maxDist = max(maxDist, dist[i][j]);
            }
        }
        if (cntEdge != cntCity - 1) return 0; // Subset form an invalid subtree!
        return maxDist;
    }
```
