1646. Get Maximum in Generated Array
<em>
You are given an integer n. An array nums of length n + 1 is generated in the following way:

nums[0] = 0
nums[1] = 1
nums[2 * i] = nums[i] when 2 <= 2 * i <= n
nums[2 * i + 1] = nums[i] + nums[i + 1] when 2 <= 2 * i + 1 <= n
Return the maximum integer in the array nums​​​.
</em>

straightforward

```cpp
    int getMaximumGenerated(int n) {
        int mx=0;
        if(n<2) return n;
        vector<int> v(n+1);
        v[1]=1;
        for(int i=2;i<=n;i++){
            if(i%2) v[i]=v[i/2]+v[i/2+1];
            else v[i]=v[i/2];
            mx=max(mx,v[i]);
        }
        return mx;
    }
```

1647. Minimum Deletions to Make Character Frequencies Unique
<em>
A string s is called good if there are no two different characters in s that have the same frequency.

Given a string s, return the minimum number of characters you need to delete to make s good.

The frequency of a character in a string is the number of times it appears in the string. For example, in the string "aab", the frequency of 'a' is 2, while the frequency of 'b' is 1
</em>

idea: 
get each char's frequency into hashmap.
sort the frequency into map
from the largest, if it has multiple same frequency, reduce by 1 

```cpp
    int minDeletions(string s) {
        vector<int> cnt(26);
        for(char c: s) cnt[c-'a']++;
        //you can only decrease the count.
        map<int,int> mp;
        for(int i: cnt) if(i) mp[i]++; //count vs frequency
        int ans=0;
        //reduce the largest to the closest not used number
        while(mp.size()){
            auto it=mp.rbegin();
            if(it->second>1){
                ans+=it->second-1;
                if(it->first>1)  mp[it->first-1]+=it->second-1;
            }
            mp.erase(it->first);
        }
        return ans;
    }
```	

1648. Sell Diminishing-Valued Colored Balls
<em>
You have an inventory of different colored balls, and there is a customer that wants orders balls of any color.

The customer weirdly values the colored balls. Each colored ball's value is the number of balls of that color you currently have in your inventory. For example, if you own 6 yellow balls, the customer would pay 6 for the first yellow ball. After the transaction, there are only 5 yellow balls left, so the next yellow ball is then valued at 5 (i.e., the value of the balls decreases as you sell more to the customer).

You are given an integer array, inventory, where inventory[i] represents the number of balls of the ith color that you initially own. You are also given an integer orders, which represents the total number of balls that the customer wants. You can sell the balls in any order.

Return the maximum total value that you can attain after selling orders colored balls. As the answer may be too large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
</em>

idea:
- sort the balls from largest to smallest.
- reduce the largest to second largest and merge with the 2nd largest.
- this does not require a heap (which will cause TLE).
we can also use binary search to remove the top (make it flat) and then remove one from the first
binary search: find the min k so that we take all A[i]>=k
note if we find the index, we will meet problem for the last step
for example [3,5] and orders=6 if we use index, we first take 2, and leave [3,3], and last step is wrong.
we shall find k=2, so that we used 4 and leave [2,2]

```cpp
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& inventory, int orders) {
        //inventory.push_back(0);
        sort(rbegin(inventory),rend(inventory));
		int l=0,n=inventory.size(),r=1e9;
		long ans=0;
        int mod=1e9+7;

		while(l<r){ //find the smallest k 
			int m=l+(r-l)/2;
			if(valid(inventory,m,orders)>=0) r=m; //make it smaller
			else l=m+1;
		}
        //cout<<l;
		for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            if(inventory[i]<l) break;
			int d=inventory[i]-l;
			ans+=(long)inventory[i]*d-(long)d*(d-1)/2;
            inventory[i]=l;
            ans%=mod;
			orders-=d;
		}
        //cout<<"OK";
        if(orders){ //remaining 
            ans+=(long)l*orders; //each take one.
            ans%=mod;
        }
		return ans;
    }
	
	int valid(vector<int>& nums,int m,int orders){
		//from m to n-1, if the sums
		for(int i=0;i<nums.size();i++){
            if(nums[i]<m) break;
			int d=nums[i]-m; //reduce to a0.
			orders-=d;
			if(orders<0) return orders;
		}
		return orders;
	}
```

Note the binary search on the descending order and find the smallest k.
actually no sort is needed. without sort, the time can be reduced half.

This one is hard!

Similarly by using map to merge same inventory together.
by the top voted: no sort.
```cpp
    map<int, int, greater<>> m;

    int maxProfit(vector<int>& A, int T) {
        long ans = 0, mod = 1e9+7, L = 0, R = *max_element(begin(A), end(A));
        for (int n : A) m[n]++;
        while (L <= R) {
            long M = (L + R) / 2;
            if (valid(M, T)) L = M + 1;
            else R = M - 1;
        }
        for (auto &[n , cnt] : m) {
            if (n <= L) break;
            T -= cnt * (n - L);
            ans = (ans + (n + L + 1) * (n - L) / 2 % mod * cnt % mod) % mod;
        }
        if (T) ans = (ans + L * T % mod) % mod;
        return ans;
    }
    bool valid(int M, int T) {
        for (auto &[n , cnt] : m) {
            if (n <= M) break;
            T -= (long)cnt * (n - M);
            if (T <= 0) return true;
        }
        return T <= 0;
    }
```

sort and merge to the next:
```cpp
int maxProfit(vector<int>& inv, int orders) {
    long res = 0, colors = 1;
    int mod=1e9+7;
    sort(begin(inv), end(inv));
    for (int i = inv.size() - 1; i >= 0 && orders > 0; --i, ++colors) {
        long cur = inv[i], prev = i > 0 ? inv[i - 1] : 0;
        long rounds = min(orders / colors, cur - prev);
        orders -= rounds * colors;
        res = (res + (cur * (cur + 1) - (cur - rounds) * (cur - rounds + 1)) / 2 * colors) % mod;
        if (cur - prev > rounds) {
            res = (res + orders * (cur - rounds)) % mod;
            break;
        }
    }
    return res;
}
```


1649. Create Sorted Array through Instructions
<em>
Given an integer array instructions, you are asked to create a sorted array from the elements in instructions. You start with an empty container nums. For each element from left to right in instructions, insert it into nums. The cost of each insertion is the minimum of the following:

The number of elements currently in nums that are strictly less than instructions[i].
The number of elements currently in nums that are strictly greater than instructions[i].
For example, if inserting element 3 into nums = [1,2,3,5], the cost of insertion is min(2, 1) (elements 1 and 2 are less than 3, element 5 is greater than 3) and nums will become [1,2,3,3,5].

Return the total cost to insert all elements from instructions into nums. Since the answer may be large, return it modulo 109 + 7
</em>

using equal_range will TLE:
```cpp
    int createSortedArray(vector<int>& instructions) {
        int mod=1e9+7;
        vector<int> v;
        long ans=0;
        for(int i: instructions){
            if(v.empty()) v.push_back(i);
            else { //binary search to find the position
                auto t=equal_range(begin(v),end(v),i);
                ans+=min(distance(v.begin(),t.first),distance(t.second,v.end()));
                v.insert(t.second,i);
                ans%=mod;
                
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
```
