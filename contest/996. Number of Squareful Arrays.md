Given an array A of non-negative integers, the array is squareful if for every pair of adjacent elements, their sum is a perfect square.

Return the number of permutations of A that are squareful.  Two permutations A1 and A2 differ if and only if there is some index i such that A1[i] != A2[i].

### Approach
Direct using permutation will yield O(n!) complexity and is to get TLE
We can build a graph and using dfs (backtracking) to solve this problem

```cpp
    unordered_map<int, int> count;
    unordered_map<int, unordered_set<int>> cand;
    int res = 0;
    int numSquarefulPerms(vector<int>& A) {
        for (int &a : A) count[a]++;
        for (auto &i : count) {
            for (auto &j : count) {
                int x = i.first, y = j.first, s = sqrt(x + y);
                if (s * s == x + y)
                    cand[x].insert(y);
            }
        }
        for (auto e : count)
            dfs(e.first, A.size() - 1);
        return res;
    }

    void dfs(int x, int left) {
        count[x]--;
        if (!left) res++;
        for (int y : cand[x])
            if (count[y] > 0)
                dfs(y, left - 1);
        count[x]++;
    }
```

cand: the hashmap for the connection graph
count: the hashmap to record duplicate items and also used for record if the item is used or not
count[x]++ -- is for the backtracking.
