### problem summary
given a list of cards, the following operation
take the top one, move the second one to the bottom
need to form a list in increasing order
return the original order of the cards

### idea
reverse build the deck
the largest one first
when there are two or more cards, move the top one to the bottom and then add the new one
using a deque to add and pop easily

### code
```cpp
    vector<int> deckRevealedIncreasing(vector<int>& deck) {
        //smallest always on top
        sort(deck.begin(),deck.end(),greater<int>());
        deque<int> dq;
        //reverse build the array, put back the cards sequentially
        //before add the card, we need bring the back to the front
        for(int i=0;i<deck.size();i++)
        {
            if(dq.size()>=2) 
            {
                dq.push_front(dq.back());
                dq.pop_back();
            }
            dq.push_front(deck[i]);
        }
        return vector<int>(dq.begin(),dq.end());
    }

```
