### Problem Summary
There are N piles of stones arranged in a row.  The i-th pile has stones[i] stones.

A move consists of merging exactly K consecutive piles into one pile, and the cost of this move is equal to the total number of stones in these K piles.

Find the minimum cost to merge all piles of stones into one pile.  If it is impossible, return -1.

### Analysis
1. K>1. other K has no solution
2. each time k piles reduce to 1 pile. so the number of pile must be able to divide by k-1
3. this is very similar to the burst balloon problem which is a typical dp problem.
assuming we choose ith element as the start, k is the length, it divides the left and right part. 
However, the subproblem needs cross the mid element. 
Similarly to the solution in burst balloon, we can think it in reversed way:
assuming starting i and ending j elements (some elements are already used) are the last action to merge
