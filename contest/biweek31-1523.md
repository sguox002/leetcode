### 1523. Count odd numbers in an interval range
given range [L,R], count how many odd numbers
idea: reduce to neighboring distance to 1.
```cpp
    int countOdds(int low, int high) {
        return (high+1)/2-low/2;
    }
```

Note: low side: left biased, high side: right biased.

### 1524. Number of Sub-arrays With Odd Sum
<em>
Given an array of integers arr. Return the number of sub-arrays with odd sum.

As the answer may grow large, the answer must be computed modulo 10^9 + 7.
</em>

dp approach:
odd[i] is the number of odd subarrays ending with element i.
and our final answer is the sum of all odd[i].

- if current number is odd, then odd[i]=1+even[i-1]
- if current number is even then eve[i]=1+odd[i-1]

```cpp
    int numOfSubarrays(vector<int>& arr) {
        int mod=1e9+7;
        //ending with a[i]
        int n=arr.size();
        vector<int> odd(n+1),even(n+1);//number of odd/even with length n
        even[0]=0;
        int ans=0;
        for(int i=1;i<=n;i++){
            if(arr[i-1]%2){ //current is odd, attached to previous even
                odd[i]=1+even[i-1];//itself is an odd
                even[i]=odd[i-1];
            }
            else { //even
                odd[i]=odd[i-1];
                even[i]=1+even[i-1];//itself is an even
            }
            ans+=odd[i];
            ans%=mod;
        }
        return ans;
    }
```

### 1525. Number of Good Ways to Split a String
<em>
You are given a string s, a split is called good if you can split s into 2 non-empty strings p and q where its concatenation is equal to s and the number of distinct letters in p and q are the same.

Return the number of good splits you can make in s.
</em>

sliding window: possible cut from 0 to n-2.

```cpp
    int numSplits(string s) {
        //sliding window
        vector<int> cnt(26),v(26);
        for(char c: s) cnt[c-'a']++;
        int ans=0;
        for(int i=0;i<s.size()-1;i++){
            char c=s[i];
            v[c-'a']++;
            ans+=valid(v,cnt);
            //cout<<i<<" "<<ans<<endl;
        }
        return ans;
    }
    bool valid(vector<int>& a, vector<int>& b){
        int suma=0,sumb=0;
        for(int i=0;i<26;i++){
            suma+=a[i]>0;
            sumb+=(b[i]-a[i])>0;
        }
        return suma==sumb;
    }
```

### 1526. Minimum Number of Increments on Subarrays to Form a Target Array
</em>
Given an array of positive integers target and an array initial of same size with all zeros.

Return the minimum number of operations to form a target array from initial if you are allowed to do the following operation:

Choose any subarray from initial and increment each value by one.
The answer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
</em>
equivalent from 0 to target or from target to 0.
for example [1,2,3,2,1]
first reduce the min to 0. [0,1,2,1,0]
then reduce the next min [0,0,1,0,0]
total 3 steps.
[3,1,5,4,2]->
[2,0,4,3,1]->
[1,0,4,3,1]->
[0,0,4,3,1]->
[0,0,3,2,0]->
[0,0,2,1,0]->
[0,0,1,0,0]->
[0,0,0,0,0]

we can do like this:
it seems a monotonic stack problem. The local max determines the number of steps.
for example: [3,1,5,4,2], we need 3 steps first to bring 3 to 0
then we see 5, need 4 steps (not 2).

this hints us to accumulate the difference.

```cpp
    int minNumberOperations(vector<int>& A) {
        int res = A[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < A.size(); ++i)
            res += max(A[i] - A[i - 1], 0);
        return res;
    }
```
explanation:

We encounter a number less than a[0] (a[1] < a[0]): In this case we can simply reuse the same operations that we did for a[0]. i.e If array was (3, 2), we can first perform 3 operations and then use 2 of the same operations in next term. However, going forward, we will only have a[1] operations available for reuse.

We encounter a number greater than a[0] (a[1] > a[0]): In this case we can simply reuse the same operations that we did for a[0]. And additionally, we will perform a[1] - a[0] more operation to reach a[1]. Again, going forward, we will have a[1] operations available for reuse.
