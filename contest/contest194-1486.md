### 1486. XOR Operation in an Array
<em>
Given an integer n and an integer start.

Define an array nums where nums[i] = start + 2*i (0-indexed) and n == nums.length.

Return the bitwise XOR of all elements of nums.
</em>

brutal force
```cpp
    int xorOperation(int n, int start) {
        int ans=0;
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
            ans^=start+2*i;
        return ans;
    }
```
with some thinking:
the last bit for all elements are the same. so we can get the last bit by the odd/even of the length.
we do it recursively and it is O(32)


### 1487. Making File Names Unique
<em>
Given an array of strings names of size n. You will create n folders in your file system such that, at the ith minute, you will create a folder with the name names[i].

Since two files cannot have the same name, if you enter a folder name which is previously used, the system will have a suffix addition to its name in the form of (k), where, k is the smallest positive integer such that the obtained name remains unique.

Return an array of strings of length n where ans[i] is the actual name the system will assign to the ith folder when you create it.
</em>
```cpp
    vector<string> getFolderNames(vector<string>& names) {
        unordered_map<string,int> m;// A map to store whether the particular name occurs how many times already
        for(int i=0;i<names.size();i++)
        {
            if(m.find(names[i])!=m.end())// if the name already came
            {
                int k=m[names[i]];// it contains the number in brackets
                while(m.find(names[i]+"("+to_string(k)+")")!=m.end())
                {
                    k++;// Increase number until that didn't exist
                    m[names[i]]++;//mean while update in the map too
                }
                m[names[i]]++;// Recently we will use one more number so increment
                 names[i]=names[i]+"("+to_string(k)+")";
            }
            m[names[i]]=1;// Here we are storing  for example ...abc(1)=1 and abc(2)=1 it means abc(1) occcured one time, and abc=2 it means abc occured 2 times.
			/*
			Suppose you have a file named ABC occurring twice, we will store ABC with occurrence =2 and ABC(1) with occurrence =1... It helps when we get another file with name ABC(1) we can store like ABC(1)(1)
			*/
			
        }
        return names;
    }
```

### 1488. Avoid Flood in The City

<em>
Your country has an infinite number of lakes. Initially, all the lakes are empty, but when it rains over the nth lake, the nth lake becomes full of water. If it rains over a lake which is full of water, there will be a flood. Your goal is to avoid the flood in any lake.

Given an integer array rains where:

rains[i] > 0 means there will be rains over the rains[i] lake.
rains[i] == 0 means there are no rains this day and you can choose one lake this day and dry it.
Return an array ans where:

ans.length == rains.length
ans[i] == -1 if rains[i] > 0.
ans[i] is the lake you choose to dry in the ith day if rains[i] == 0.
If there are multiple valid answers return any of them. If it is impossible to avoid flood return an empty array.

Notice that if you chose to dry a full lake, it becomes empty, but if you chose to dry an empty lake, nothing changes. (see example 4)

</em>

```cpp
    vector<int> avoidFlood(vector<int>& rains) {
        vector<int> res(rains.size(),-1);
        unordered_map<int, int> m;
        set<int> zero;
        for(int i =0; i < rains.size(); ++i)
        {
            if(rains[i] == 0)
            {
                zero.insert(i);
                res[i] = 1;
            }
            else
            {
                if(m.count(rains[i]))
                {
                    int lastIndex = m[rains[i]];
                    auto zeroIndex = zero.upper_bound(lastIndex);
                    if(zeroIndex == zero.end())
                    {
                        return {};
                    }
                    res[*zeroIndex] = rains[i];
                    zero.erase(zeroIndex);
                }
                m[rains[i]] = i;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
```

### 1489. Find Critical and Pseudo-Critical Edges in Minimum Spanning Tree
<em>
Given a weighted undirected connected graph with n vertices numbered from 0 to n-1, and an array edges where edges[i] = [fromi, toi, weighti] represents a bidirectional and weighted edge between nodes fromi and toi. A minimum spanning tree (MST) is a subset of the edges of the graph that connects all vertices without cycles and with the minimum possible total edge weight.

Find all the critical and pseudo-critical edges in the minimum spanning tree (MST) of the given graph. An MST edge whose deletion from the graph would cause the MST weight to increase is called a critical edge. A pseudo-critical edge, on the other hand, is that which can appear in some MSTs but not all.

Note that you can return the indices of the edges in any order.
</em>
critical edge appears in all MST
pseudo critical edges appear in only part of MST
MST: connect the graph with min number of edges, weighted need to get the min sum.
MST often uses union-find the form it.

n = 5, edges = [[0,1,1],[1,2,1],[2,3,2],[0,3,2],[0,4,3],[3,4,3],[1,4,6]]

union-find:
- sort the edges (combined with index) according to weight.
- for the MST and get the sum of weight (rank).
- delete ith edge and calculate the MST's rank. if cannot form a rank, return max.
- if taken away the rank increases, this is a critical connection.
- if include the edge the rank no changes, this is a non-critical connection (but it shall be inside the some of the MST).
for example edge 6, it is not noncritical edge since it is not part of MST.
```cpp
	vector<int> parent;
	int sz;
    vector<vector<int>> findCriticalAndPseudoCriticalEdges(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
		for(int i=0;i<edges.size();i++) edges[i].push_back(i);
		sort(begin(edges),end(edges),[](vector<int>& a,vector<int>& b){
			return a[2]<b[2];
		});
		vector<int> critical,noncritical;
		int rank=getMST(edges,-1,-1,n); //with remove an edge.
		for(int i=0;i<edges.size();i++){
            //cout<<i<<" "<<r<<endl;
			if(getMST(edges,i,-1,n)>rank) critical.push_back(edges[i][3]);
			else if(getMST(edges,-1,i,n)==rank) noncritical.push_back(edges[i][3]);
		}
		return {critical,noncritical};
    }
	int getMST(vector<vector<int>>& edges,int rm,int add,int n){
		int ans=0;
		parent.resize(n);
		for(int i=0;i<n;i++) parent[i]=i;
		sz=n;
		if(add>=0) parent[edges[add][0]]=edges[add][1],sz--,ans+=edges[add][2];
		for(int i=0;i<edges.size();i++){
            auto& e=edges[i];
			if(i==rm || i==add) continue;
			int pi=findp(e[0]),pj=findp(e[1]);
			if(pi!=pj) {
				parent[pi]=pj;
				ans+=e[2];
				sz--;
			}
		}
		return sz==1?ans:INT_MAX;
	}
	int findp(int i){
		while(parent[i]!=i) {
			parent[i]=parent[parent[i]];
			i=parent[i];
		}
		return i;
	}
```	
Note:
- final result shall be original index.
- with path compression. parent[parent[i]]->parent[i]->i.
- delete an edge for critical, add an edge for noncritical.
