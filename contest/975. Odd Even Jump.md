### Problem summary
Given a list of numbers, you can start at some indices and make a series of jump:
odd jump: you jump to smallest index which is >= current
even jump: you jump to smallest index which is <=current
An index is good if you can jump to the end. 
return all the good indices.

### Approach
If not good to do it in one direction, what about the reverse direction?
Actually it is much easier, take a small example:
[10,13,12,14,15]
take 15: it is already the end, odd=1, even=1, +1
take 14: 1 step to end, odd=1, even=0, +1
take 12: 1 step to 14, odd=1, even=0, +1
take 13: odd you have to first jump to 14, but it is even jump, even has to jump to 12, odd=0, even=0
take 10: odd jump to 13, even jump: no legal, but 13 is not a good jump.

So it is a dp: 
we can put the visited nodes into a sorted order and then binary search to find the next number to jump for odd and even jump and check if it is legal.

There is one thing I missed: it also requires the first jump is odd, second jump is even!!!!!


```cpp
    int oddEvenJumps(vector<int>& A) {
        int n  = A.size(), res = 1;
        vector<int> higher(n), lower(n);
        higher[n - 1] = lower[n - 1] = 1;
        map<int, int> map;
        map[A[n - 1]] = n - 1;
        for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; --i) {
            auto hi = map.lower_bound(A[i]), lo = map.upper_bound(A[i]);
            if (hi != map.end()) higher[i] = lower[hi->second];
            if (lo != map.begin()) lower[i] = higher[(--lo)->second];
            if (higher[i]) res++;
            map[A[i]] = i;
        }
        return res;
    }
```
