### Problem
Given an array A of integers, we must modify the array in the following way: we choose an i and replace A[i] with -A[i], and we repeat this process K times in total.  (We may choose the same index i multiple times.)

Return the largest possible sum of the array after modifying it in this way.

### Approach
Naive greedy
sort and convert the smallest negative first
until all negatives are converted and K is not exhausted, compare the first positive with the previous negative and choose the abs smaller one to convert.

```cpp
    int largestSumAfterKNegations(vector<int>& A, int K) {
        int ans=0;
        sort(A.begin(),A.end());
        int t=A[0],i=0;
        while(A[i]<0 && K) {A[i]*=-1;K--;t=A[i];i++;}
        if(K%2) {if(A[i]>t) A[i-1]*=-1;else A[i]*=-1;}
        return accumulate(A.begin(),A.end(),0);
    }
```
