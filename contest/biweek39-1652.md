### 1652. Defuse the Bomb
<em>
You have a bomb to defuse, and your time is running out! Your informer will provide you with a circular array code of length of n and a key k.

To decrypt the code, you must replace every number. All the numbers are replaced simultaneously.

If k > 0, replace the ith number with the sum of the next k numbers.
If k < 0, replace the ith number with the sum of the previous k numbers.
If k == 0, replace the ith number with 0.
As code is circular, the next element of code[n-1] is code[0], and the previous element of code[0] is code[n-1].

Given the circular array code and an integer key k, return the decrypted code to defuse the bomb!
</em>

straightforward

```cpp
    vector<int> decrypt(vector<int>& code, int k) {
                //k>0 next k 
        vector<int> ans(code.size());
        if(k==0) return ans;
        int dir=1,n=code.size();
        if(k<0) dir=-1,k*=-1;
        for(int i=0;i<code.size();i++){
            int sum=0;
            for(int j=1;j<=k;j++){
                sum+=code[(i+dir*j+n)%n];
            }
            ans[i]=sum;
        }
        return ans;
    }
```

### 1653. Minimum Deletions to Make String Balanced
<em>
You are given a string s consisting only of characters 'a' and 'b'​​​​.

You can delete any number of characters in s to make s balanced. s is balanced if there is no pair of indices (i,j) such that i < j and s[i] = 'b' and s[j]= 'a'.

Return the minimum number of deletions needed to make s balanced.
Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 105
s[i] is 'a' or 'b'
 </em>

equivalent: long non-decreasing subsequence
using dp, it will be O(N^2) and will TLE.
O(nlogn) will be OK. see 300. longest increasing subsequence
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/longest-monotonically-increasing-subsequence-size-n-log-n/

here we needs non-increasing subsequence by using upper_bound.
```cpp
    int minimumDeletions(string s) {
        //delete to make string sorted.
        //when not sorted we need either delete the first or the second
        //longest increasing subsequence using binary search

        string res;
        for(int i=0; i<s.size(); i++) {
            auto it = std::upper_bound(res.begin(), res.end(), s[i]); //find the >=
            if(it==res.end()) res.push_back(s[i]);
            else *it = s[i];
        }
        return s.size()-res.size();
    }
```
res is the tail array storing the smallest tail of all increasing subsequence with length i+1 for tail[i].
Each time we only do one of the two:

(1) if x is larger than all tails, append it, increase the size by 1
(2) if tails[i-1] < x <= tails[i], update tails[i]
Doing so will maintain the tails invariant. The the final answer is just the size.

O(N) solution using stack (greedy approach):
we are counting number of ba pairs. each pair needs to remove one char.

```cpp
    //Idea is to traverse from right to left & use stack to keep track if 'b' comes before 'a' in string
    //then we need to pop & need to delete that character
    int minimumDeletions(string s) {
        stack<char> st;
        int n =s.size();
        int res = 0;
        
        for(int i = n-1; i >=0; i--){
            char c = s[i];
            if(!st.empty() && st.top() < c){
                res++;
                st.pop();
            }else{
                st.push(c);
            }
        }
        
        return res;
    }
```
note: we count the reversed pairs, and does not add the char into stack.

greedy: the final sorted shall be axxxxbbbb...b. so we only need to count the left a and right b and then get the max sum.
and then delete all right a and left b (the split spot).

### 1654. Minimum Jumps to Reach Home
<em>
A certain bug's home is on the x-axis at position x. Help them get there from position 0.

The bug jumps according to the following rules:

It can jump exactly a positions forward (to the right).
It can jump exactly b positions backward (to the left).
It cannot jump backward twice in a row.
It cannot jump to any forbidden positions.
The bug may jump forward beyond its home, but it cannot jump to positions numbered with negative integers.

Given an array of integers forbidden, where forbidden[i] means that the bug cannot jump to the position forbidden[i], and integers a, b, and x, return the minimum number of jumps needed for the bug to reach its home. If there is no possible sequence of jumps that lands the bug on position x, return -1.
</em>

2d state bfs:
a position can be jumped from left side or from right side.

```cpp
	int minimumJumps(vector<int>& forbidden, int a, int b, int x) {
		unordered_set<int> forbi(forbidden.begin(), forbidden.end());
		vector<vector<int>> visited(2,vector<int>(5000));
		// visited array has two states:
		// visited[0][i] means the ith cell was reached from its left hand side jumping forward, 
		// visited[1][i] means the ith cell was reached from its right hand side jumping backward. 
		queue<pair<int,bool>> qu; 
		// true means your last jump was backward jumping, you cannot jump backward in current step.
		// false, otherwise.
		qu.push({0,false});
		visited[0][0] = 1;
		visited[1][0] = 1;
		int ans = 0;
		while(!qu.empty()) {
			int len = qu.size();
			while(len > 0) {
				len--;
				int cur = qu.front().first;
				bool flag = qu.front().second;
				if(cur == x) {
					return ans;
				}
				qu.pop();
				int forward = cur + a;
				int backward = cur - b;
				if(forward < 5000 && visited[0][forward] == 0 && !forbi.count(forward)) {
					qu.push({forward,false});
					visited[0][forward] = 1;
				}
				if(backward >=0 && visited[1][backward] == 0 && !forbi.count(backward) && !flag) {
					qu.push({backward,true});
					visited[1][backward] = 1;
				}
			}
			ans++;
		}
		return -1;
	}
```	
	
### 1655. Distribute Repeating Integers
<em>
You are given an array of n integers, nums, where there are at most 50 unique values in the array. You are also given an array of m customer order quantities, quantity, where quantity[i] is the amount of integers the ith customer ordered. Determine if it is possible to distribute nums such that:

The ith customer gets exactly quantity[i] integers,
The integers the ith customer gets are all equal, and
Every customer is satisfied.
Return true if it is possible to distribute nums according to the above conditions
</em>

backtracking

```cpp
    bool canDistribute(vector<int>& nums, vector<int>& quantity) {
        //you can have multiple choices to fulfill the orders
        unordered_map<int,int> mp; //up to 50 values
        for(int i: nums) mp[i]++;
        //dp approach: we have to satisfy every one
        vector<int> v;
        for(auto t: mp) v.push_back(t.second);
        sort(rbegin(quantity),rend(quantity));
        
        int m=quantity.size();
        //if we can fullfill, the status depends on the v.
        //vector<int> dp(m,-1); //knapsack 
        return helper(v,quantity,0);
    }
    
    int helper(vector<int>& v,vector<int>& q,int start){
        if(start>=q.size()) return 1;

        for(int i=0;i<v.size();i++){
            if(v[i]>=q[start]){
                v[i]-=q[start];
                if(helper(v,q,start+1)) return 1;
                v[i]+=q[start];
            }
        }
        return 0;
    }
```

The key optimization is to sort the quantity descending order.
otherwise, we will trigger a lot of recursive calls which ends up not successful.
