1640. Check Array Formation Through Concatenation
<em>
You are given an array of distinct integers arr and an array of integer arrays pieces, where the integers in pieces are distinct. Your goal is to form arr by concatenating the arrays in pieces in any order. However, you are not allowed to reorder the integers in each array pieces[i].

Return true if it is possible to form the array arr from pieces. Otherwise, return false.
</em>

hard approach:
convert to string and the problem converted to if can form the string using dictionary strings. (dp)

simple approach: 
using hashmap, only the first number as the key.

```cpp
    bool canFormArray(vector<int>& arr, vector<vector<int>>& pieces) {
        unordered_map<int,vector<int>> mp;
        for(auto t: pieces) mp[t[0]]=t;
        int i=0;
        while(i<arr.size()){
            if(mp.count(arr[i])){
                int j=0;
                auto& t=mp[arr[i]];
                while(j<t.size()){
                    if(arr[i]!=t[j]) return 0;
                    i++,j++;
                }
            }
            else return 0;
        }
        return 1;
    }
```

1641. Count Sorted Vowel Strings
<em>
Given an integer n, return the number of strings of length n that consist only of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) and are lexicographically sorted.

A string s is lexicographically sorted if for all valid i, s[i] is the same as or comes before s[i+1] in the alphabet.
</em>

approach 1: using backtrack to count
```cpp
    int countVowelStrings(int n) {
        //backtracking will be 5^50
        //5 digits to choose
        int ans=0;
        return backtrack(n,0);
        
        for(int i=0;i<5;i++){
            ans+=backtrack(n,i);
        }
        return ans;
    }
    int backtrack(int n,int start){
        if(start>4) return 0;
        if(n==0) return 1;
        int ans=0;
        for(int i=start;i<5;i++)
            ans+=backtrack(n-1,i);
        return ans;
    }
```

seems there is a math relation:
n=1: 5
n=2: 5+4+3+2+1=15
n=3: axx=15, exx=10,ixx=6,oxx=3,uxx=1, total=35
seems can use dp to get the relation.
- add 'a' to the begin dp[i]['a']=dp[i-1]['a']+dp[i-1]['e']+dp[i-1]['i']+dp[i-1]['o']+dp[i-1]['u']
- add 'e' to the begin dp[i]['e']=dp[i-1]['e']+dp[i-1]['i']+dp[i-1]['o']+dp[i-1]['u']
- add 'i' to the begin dp[i]['i']=dp[i-1]['i']+dp[i-1]['o']+dp[i-1]['u']
- add 'o' to the begin dp[i]['o']=dp[i-1]['o']+dp[i-1]['u']
- add 'u' to the begin dp[i]['u']=dp[i-1]['u']

```cpp
    int countVowelStrings(int n) {
        //dp approach
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n,vector<int>(5));
        for(int i=0;i<5;i++) dp[0][i]=1;
        for(int i=1;i<n;i++){
            for(int j=0;j<5;j++){
                for(int k=j;k<5;k++) dp[i][j]+=dp[i-1][k];
            }
        }
        int ans=0;
        for(int i=0;i<5;i++) ans+=dp[n-1][i];
        return ans;
    }
```

1642. Furthest Building You Can Reach
<em>
You are given an integer array heights representing the heights of buildings, some bricks, and some ladders.

You start your journey from building 0 and move to the next building by possibly using bricks or ladders.

While moving from building i to building i+1 (0-indexed),

If the current building's height is greater than or equal to the next building's height, you do not need a ladder or bricks.
If the current building's height is less than the next building's height, you can either use one ladder or (h[i+1] - h[i]) bricks.
Return the furthest building index (0-indexed) you can reach if you use the given ladders and bricks optimally.
</em>

idea:

priority_queue: use ladder for the jump which needs the most bricks

```cpp
    int furthestBuilding(vector<int>& heights, int bricks, int ladders) {
        //greedy: we shall use the largest jmp for the ladder and other for the bricks
        //we can use pq to do this, once we find a larger one, 
        int n=heights.size();
        priority_queue<int> pq;
        int i=1;
        for(;i<n;i++){
            int d=heights[i]-heights[i-1];
            if(d>0){
                pq.push(d);
                if(bricks>=d){
                    bricks-=d;
                }
                else if(ladders>0){
                    if(pq.size()){ //use the ladder for larger one
                        bricks+=pq.top();
                        pq.pop();
                        //ladder--;
                        bricks-=d;
                    }
                    ladders--;//use one ladder
                }
                else break;//no more left
            }
        }
        return i-1;
    }
```	

1643. Kth Smallest Instructions
<em>
Bob is standing at cell (0, 0), and he wants to reach destination: (row, column). He can only travel right and down. You are going to help Bob by providing instructions for him to reach destination.

The instructions are represented as a string, where each character is either:

'H', meaning move horizontally (go right), or
'V', meaning move vertically (go down).
Multiple instructions will lead Bob to destination. For example, if destination is (2, 3), both "HHHVV" and "HVHVH" are valid instructions.

However, Bob is very picky. Bob has a lucky number k, and he wants the kth lexicographically smallest instructions that will lead him to destination. k is 1-indexed.

Given an integer array destination and an integer k, return the kth lexicographically smallest instructions that will take Bob to destination.
</em>

brutal force using bits. 
H represent 0 and V represent 1, then the number of set bits=m-1.
find next bigger number with same number of set bits.
```cpp
    string kthSmallestPath(vector<int>& destination, int k) {
        //from (0,0) to (m,n), we have m H and n V
        //we are looking for the kth smallest combinations
        int n=destination[0],m=destination[1];
        //using bits (m+n) bits keep set bits
        int num=(1<<n)-1;
        int mx=num<<m;
        
        while(--k) num=next_bigger(num);
        //cout<<num<<endl;
        string ans;
        while(num){
            int d=num&1;
            ans.append(1,d?'V':'H');
            num>>=1;
        }
        if(ans.size()<m+n) ans.append(m+n-ans.size(),'H');
        reverse(begin(ans),end(ans));
        return ans;
    }
    unsigned next_bigger(unsigned a) {
      /* works for any word length */
      unsigned c = (a & -a);
      unsigned r = a+c;
      return (((r ^ a) >> 2) / c) | r;
    }    
```	
This will TLE since the complexity is C(m+n,m)

Analysis: 
for example (2,3): C(5,2)=10
the order are: 
"HHHVV", 
"HHVHV", 
"HHVVH", 
"HVHHV", 
"HVHVH", 
"HVVHH", 
"VHHHV", 
"VHHVH", 
"VHVHH", 
"VVHHH"
k<=C(5,2)/2 we have H at the first char.
K>C(5,2)/2 we have V at the first char.
then we can do it by reducing the K-C(m,n)/2;

or think like this:
string start H, C(m-1+n,m-1)
string start V: C(m+n-1,n-1)
```cpp
	int comb(int m,int n){
		//m!/(n!*(m-n)!)
		int ans=1;
		for(int i=n+1;i<=m;i++) ans=ans*i/(i-n);
		return ans;
	}
    string kthSmallestPath(vector<int>& destination, int k) {
        string ans;
		int m=destination[0],n=destination[1];
		while(k && m+n){
			int t=comb(m+n-1,n-1);
			if(k>t) ans+='V',k-=t,m--;
			else ans+='H',n--;
		}
		//remaining shall be in sorted order.
		if(n) ans.append(n,'H');
		if(m) ans.append(m,'V');
		return ans;
    }
```

The thinking process is more important.
