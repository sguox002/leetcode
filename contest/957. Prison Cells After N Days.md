### Problem Summary
8 cell, when neighboring cell is the same, then it become 1, otherwise it becomes 0

Key observation:
- 8 bits only have at most 256 combinations, so when N is really large it is just repeating the pattern
- the boundary cell, the leftmost and rightmost will become 0 at the second day.
- using a hashmap to store the status and its first position, when a status appear again, we know the period.
- skipping to the remaing part and do the iteration.

### Implementation
```cpp
    vector<int> prisonAfterNDays(vector<int>& cells, int N) {
        //neigboring 0,0=>1 1,1=>0, otherwise =>0
        int n=cells.size();
        unordered_map<int,int> status;
        vector<int> curr(n);
        int period;
        for(int i=1;i<=N;)
        {
            int res=0;
            for(int j=1;j<n-1;j++)
            {
                int t=cells[j-1]+cells[j+1];
                curr[j]=t==1?0:1;
                res+=(curr[j]<<j);
            }
            if(status.count(res)) //we have a repeat pattern
            {
                period=i-status[res];
                int nskip=(N-i)/period*period;
                i+=nskip;
                i++;
            }
            else {status[res]=i;i++;}
            cells=curr;
        }
        return cells;
    }
```
